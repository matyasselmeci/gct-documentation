indexterm:[GridFTP Server]

=== Interface introduction ===

The Globus implementation of the GridFTP server draws on: 

* three IETF RFCs: 

* RFC 959

* RFC 2228

* RFC 2389

* an IETF Draft: MLST-16

* the GridFTP protocol specification, which is Global Grid Forum (GGF) Standard GFD.020.




=== Syntax of the interface ===

The command line tools and the client library completely hide the
details of the protocol from the user and the developer. Unless you
choose to use the control library, it is not necessary to have a
detailed knowledge of the protocol.
