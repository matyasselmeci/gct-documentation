GridFTP is a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer protocol
optimized for high-bandwidth wide-area networks. The GridFTP protocol is
based on FTP, the highly-popular Internet file transfer protocol. We
have selected a set of protocol features and extensions defined already
in IETF RFCs and added a few additional features to meet requirements
from current data grid projects.
