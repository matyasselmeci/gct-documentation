[[gridftp-SRB-intro]]
=== Introduction ===

The Storage Resource Broker Data Storage Interface (SRB-DSI) is an
extension to the GridFTP server that allows it to interact with SRB.
Plugging this extension into a GridFTP server allows the GridFTP server
to access a SRB resource and serve it to any GridFTP client as though it
were a filesystem.


[[gridftp-SRB-architecture]]
=== Architecture ===

image:srb-dsi.png[align="center"]

The above image shows the architecture of the system. There are 4 major
components:


* **SRB Server **- This is where the data is stored. It is accessed by the GridFTP server via the standard SRB protocols using GSI_AUTH.

* **SRB-DSI** - This component is the bridge between GridFTP and SRB. All operation requests and data are routed through this component. The GridFTP server makes requests of it, then it translates these requests into SRB client commands.

* **GridFTP Server** - A standard GridFTP 6.0 server is loaded with the SRB-DSI. Clients contact this server to access data in a SRB resource. The server passes the request to the SRB-DSI which, as described above, passes the request on to the SRB server. The responses to the requests return along the same path.

* **GridFTP Client **- A stock GridFTP client (like **++globus-url-copy++**). No modifications to the client are needed.



[[gridftp-SRB-software]]
=== Software ===

You need the following items to use the SRB-DSI:




* **Globus Toolkit** - You need the GridFTP distributed with GT (compatible with 4.0.1 or later). You can find that http://www.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/{$version}/[here].

* **SRB Client 3.4.0** - You only need the client libraries to build the SRB-DSI, but you will need access to a running SRB server and resource. You can find the client libraries http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/tarfiles/main.html[here].

* **SRB-DSI **- You can find the SRB-DSI http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~bresnaha/SRB%5fDSI%5fDoc/globus%5fsrb%5fdsi-latest.tar.gz[here].



[[gridftp-SRB-building]]
=== Building ===

Instructions for building link:../../admin/install/index.html[Globus]
and http://www.sdsc.edu/srb[SRB] are well documented in the above links.
The following sections describe one way of building these two packages.
However, if any questions or errors are discovered, the reader should
look to the above links for solutions.


[[gridftp-SRB-building-globus]]
==== Building Globus ====

Download the source installer, choose a path on your filesystem for your
++GLOBUS_LOCATION++, and run the following:



--------

% bunzip2 gtversion-all-source-installer.tar.bz2
% tar -xvf gtversion-all-source-installer.tar
% export GLOBUS_LOCATION=<path you chose for your GLOBUS_LOCATION>
% ./configure --prefix=$GLOBUS_LOCATION
% make gridftp globus_gridftp_server-thr
% source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
--------


[[gridftp-SRB-building-SRB]]
==== Building SRB ====



--------

% ./configure  --enable-gsi-auth --enable-globus-location=$GLOBUS_LOCATION --enable-globus-flavor=<a threaded globus flavor>
% make
--------


[[gridftp-SRB-building-SRBDSI]]
==== Building SRB-DSI ====

The SRB-DSI is a GPT package. More information about GPT package
installation can be found http://www.gridpackagingtools.org/[here]. Most
users should simply need:



--------

gpt-build -force CONFIGOPTS_GPTMACRO="--with-srb-path=<location of SRB source tree>"  globus_srb_dsi-0.13.tar.gz <threaded flavor>
--------


[[gridftp-SRB-administration]]
=== Administration ===

Before you can run the GridFTP server with the SRB-DSI, you need to set
up some files. 


[[gridftp-SRB-config-file]]
==== Creating and setting up the SRB configuration file ====

A configuration file must be created at:



--------
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp_srb.conf
--------

The following values must be set in this file:



--------

srb_hostname <host>:<port>
srb_hostname_dn <domain name to expect from SRB server>
srb_default_resource <default srb resource to use>
--------


[[gridftp-SRB-gridmap-file]]
==== Setting up the gridmap file ====

Additionally, the gridmap file must be special for this DSI. Along with
the subject name and username, the SRB-DSI needs to know the SRB domain
name for the user. This is handled by adding an additional value to the
gridmap file:



--------
 
"<user security DN>" <srb user name>@<domain name>
--------


[[gridftp-SRB-running]]
=== Running ===

Once you have the configuration files in place, you can run the server. 

[IMPORTANT]
--
All options of the server apply, but the parameter ++-dsi srb -auth-level 4++**must** also be used.
--
For more information on setting these values and running the GridFTP
server see link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-configuring[Configuring
GridFTP]. 

Most users can run with:



--------
 
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -p <port> -dsi srb -auth-level 4
--------
