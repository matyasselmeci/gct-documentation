indexterm:[troubleshooting for GridFTP]


--
If you are having problems using the GridFTP server, try the steps
listed below. If you have an error, try checking the server logs if you
have access to them. By default, the server logs to stderr, unless it is
running from inetd, or its execution mode is detached, in which case
logging is disabled by default. 

The command line options -d , -log-level, -L and -logdir can affect
where logs will be written, as can the configuration file options
log_single and log_unique. See 
link:../../gridftp/pi/index.html#globus-gridftp-server[globus-gridftp-server]
for more
information on these and other configuration options.

=== Establish control channel connection ===

Verify that you can establish a control channel connection and that the
server has started successfully by telnetting to the port on which the
server is running: 



--------
% telnet localhost 2811
                Trying 127.0.0.1...
                Connected to localhost.
                Escape character is '^]'.
                220 GridFTP Server mldev.mcs.anl.gov 2.0 (gcc32dbg, 1113865414-1) ready.
--------

If you see anything other than a 220 banner such as the one above, the
server has not started correctly.

Verify that there are no configuration files being unexpectedly loaded
from /etc/grid-security/gridftp.conf or
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf. If those files exist, and you did not
intend for them to be used, rename them to .save, or specify -c none on
the command line and try again.

If you can log into the machine where the server is, try running the
server from the command line with only the -s option: 



--------
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -s
--------

The server will print the port it is listening on: 



--------
Server listening at gridftp.mcs.anl.gov:57764
--------

Now try and telnet to that port. If you still do not get the banner
listed above, something is preventing the socket connection. Check
firewalls, tcp-wrapper, etc.

If you now get a correct banner, add -p 2811 (you will have to disable
(x)inetd on port 2811 if you are using them or you will get port already
in use):



--------
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -s -p 2811
--------

Now telnet to port 2811. If this does not work, something is blocking
port 2811. Check firewalls, tcp-wrapper, etc.

If this works correctly then re-enable your normal server, but remove
all options but -i, -s, or -S.

Now telnet to port 2811. If this does not work, something is wrong with
your service configuration. Check /etc/services and (x)inetd config,
have (x)inetd restarted, etc.

If this works, begin adding options back one at a time, verifying that
you can telnet to the server after each option is added. Continue this
till you find the problem or get all the options you want. 

At this point, you can establish a control connection. Now try running
globus-url-copy.


=== Try running globus-url-copy ===

Once you've verified that you can establish a control connection, try to
make a transfer using globus-url-copy.

If you are doing a client/server transfer (one of your URLs has
++file:++ in it) then try: in it) then try:



--------
globus-url-copy -vb -dbg gsiftp://host.server.running.on/dev/zero file:///dev/null
--------

This will run until you control-c the transfer. If that works, reverse
the direction:



--------
globus-url-copy -vb -dbg file:///dev/zero gsiftp://host.server.running.on/dev/null
--------

Again, this will run until you control-c the transfer.

If you are doing a third party
            transfer, run this command:



--------
globus-url-copy -vb -dbg gsiftp://host.server1.on/dev/zero gsiftp://host.server2.on/dev/null
--------

Again, this will run until you control-c the transfer.

If the above transfers work, try your transfer again. If it fails, you
likely have some sort of file permissions problem, typo in a file name,
etc.


=== If your server starts... ===

If the server has started correctly, and your problem is with a security
failure or gridmap lookup failure, verify that you have security
configured properly
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-basic-security[here].

If the server is running and your client successfully authenticates but
has a problem at some other time during the session, please ask for help
on http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Mailing%5fLists[gt-user@globus.org]. When
you send mail or submit bugs, please always include as much of the
following information as possible:




* Specs on all hosts involved (OS, processor, RAM, etc).

* globus-url-copy -version

* globus-url-copy -versions

* Output from the telnet test above.

* The actual command line you ran with -dbg added. Don't worry if the output gets long.

* Check that you are getting a FQDN and /etc/hosts that is sane.

* The server configuration and setup (/etc/services entries, (x)inetd configs, etc.).

* Any relevant lines from the server logs (not the entire log please).



[[gridftp-troubleshooting-latency]]
=== High latency for GridFTP server connections ===

If you run GridFTP servers via Xinetd and notice high latency for
connections and/or transfers, check if ++/etc/xinetd.conf++ or the
gsiftp service configuration inside  or the gsiftp service configuration
inside ++/etc/xinetd.d++ is set to log USERID as follows:  is set to log
USERID as follows: 

--------
log_on_success += USERID
log_on_failure += USERID
--------


Such a configuration tells Xinetd to log the remote user using the
method defined in RFC 1413, which causes an ident client to attempt to
query the machine that the connection is coming from before the service
will run. Even when this succeeds, the response can't be trusted, and
more often than not it is rejected or simply dropped (which results in
the longest delays) by the remote firewall.

Latency can be reduced by making sure Xinetd does **not** log the
USERID.
