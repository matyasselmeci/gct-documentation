== Using GridFTP for Data Movement ==


[[gridftp-user-quickstart-building]]
=== GridFTP clients ===

The http://www.globus.org[Globus Service] is the recommended interface
to move data to and from GridFTP servers. Globus Online provides a web
GUI, command line interface and a REST API for GridFTP data movement. It
provides automatic fault recovery and automatic tuning of optimization
parameters to achieve high performance. 

The Globus Toolkit provides a GridFTP client called ++globus-url-copy++,
a command line interface, suitable for scripting. For example, the
following command:

--------
globus-url-copy gsiftp://remote.host.edu/path/to/file
   file:///path/on/local/host
--------

would transfer a file from a remote host to the locally accessible path
specified in the second URL.

The Globus Toolkit also provides
http://www.globus.org/api/c-globus-{$version}/globus%5fftp%5fclient/html/index.html[FTP
client libraries in C] and the
http://www.globus.org/toolkit/jglobus/[jGlobus] provides Java client
libraries for building custom GridFTP clients.

[[gridftp-user-quickstart-config-security]]
==== Configuring security ====


===== SSH Security =====

There is no additional configuration required to use GridFTP in
conjunction with SSH.


===== GSI Security =====

In order to use GSI security for the transfers, you need to obtain and
install a user certificate from a certificate authority trusted by the
GridFTP servers that you wish to move data in and out of, and configure
the client to trust the certificate authority that signed the
certificates of the GridFTP server(s)

certificates]

[[gridftp-user-basic]]
=== Basic procedure for using globus-url-copy ===
indexterm:[moving files,basic procedure]

If you just want the "rules of thumb" on getting started (without all
the details), the following options using ++globus-url-copy++ will
normally give acceptable performance: 

For a single file transfer:



--------
globus-url-copy -vb -p 4 source_url destination_url
--------

where: 

**-vb**::
     specifies verbose mode and displays: 

* number of bytes transferred,

* performance since the last update (currently every 5 seconds), and

* average performance for the whole transfer.

**-p**::
     Specifies the number of parallel data connections that should be used.
This is one of the most commonly used options.
+
link:../../gridftp/user/index.html#globus-url-copy-parallelismvalue[How
do I pick a value?]


For a directory transfer:



--------
globus-url-copy -vb -p 4  -r -cd - cc 4 source_url destination_url
--------

where: 

**-cc**::
     Specifies the number of concurrent FTP connections to use for multiple
transfers.

**-cd**::
     Creates destination directories, if needed.

**-r**::
     Copies files in subdirectories.


The source/destination URLs will normally be one of the following:




* 'file:///path/to/my/file' if you are accessing a file on a file system accessible by the host on which you are running your client.

* 'gsiftp://hostname/path/to/remote/file' if you are accessing a file from a GridFTP server.



[[gridftp-user-putting]]
==== Uploading files to a server ====
indexterm:[moving files,from your file system to the server]

One of the most basic tasks in GridFTP is to "put" files, i.e., moving a
file from your file system to the server. So for example, if you want to
move the file ++/tmp/foo++ from a file system accessible to the host on
which you are running your client to a file name  from a file system
accessible to the host on which you are running your client to a file
name ++/tmp/bar++ on a host named  on a host named
++remote.machine.my.edu++ running a GridFTP server, you would use this
command: running a GridFTP server, you would use this command:



--------
globus-url-copy -vb -p 4 file:///tmp/foo gsiftp://remote.machine.my.edu/tmp/bar
--------

[NOTE]
--
In theory, ++remote.machine.my.edu++ could be the same host as the one on which you are running your client, but that is normally only done in testing situations.  could be the same host as the one on which you are running your client, but that is normally only done in testing situations.

[[gridftp-user-getting]]
==== Downloading files from a server ====
indexterm:[moving files,from a server to your file system]

A get, i.e, moving a file from a server to your file system, would just
reverse the source and destination URLs:

[TIP]
--
Remember 'file:' always refers to your file system.
--




--------
globus-url-copy -vb -p 4 gsiftp://remote.machine.my.edu/tmp/bar file:///tmp/foo
--------


[[gridftp-user-thirdpartytransfers]]
==== Third party transfers between two remote servers ====
indexterm:[moving files,between two GridFTP servers (a third party transfer)]

Finally, if you want to move a file between two GridFTP servers (a third
party transfer), both URLs would use ++gsiftp:++ as the protocol: as the
protocol:



--------
globus-url-copy -vb -p 4 gsiftp://other.machine.my.edu/tmp/foo gsiftp://remote.machine.my.edu/tmp/bar
--------

line options], the link:../../gridftp/key/index.html[GT 6.0 GridFTP Key
Concepts] gives basic
definitions and an overview of the GridFTP protocol as well as our
implementation of it.


[[gridftp-user-ftp]]
=== Using standard FTP clients with GridFTP server ===

You can use any standard FTP client to communicate with the GridFTP
server in the following cases:




* GridFTP server is configured to allow anonymous access or
username/password based authentication. Note that this method is not
secure but if the data on the GridFTP server is world readable or if the
GridFTP server is accessible only to the clients on a trusted internal
network, the GridFTP server may be configured to allow anonymous access
or username/password based authentication

* Your local system administrator has installed "GridFTP Where There is
FTP (GWTFTP)", which acts as a proxy between standard FTP clients and
GridFTP servers. More information on GWTFTP is available at
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-gwtftp[GridFTP Where There Is
FTP (GWTFTP)].



[[gridftp-user-advanced]]
=== Advanced Features ===


[[gridftp-user-advanced-failures]]
==== Failures and retries ====

To retry a transfer after a server or network failure, use the '-rst'
option. To store the untransferred urls for restarting the transfer
after a client failure, use the '-df' option. More information about
these options is available link:#globus-url-copy-reliability[here].

For example, **++globus-url-copy++** can be invoked in a loop for long
running transfers, as shown in the script below:



--------

     #!/bin/sh
     STATEFILE=/path/to/statefile; 
     while  [ ! -e $STATEFILE -o -s $STATEFILE ]; 
     do 
     globus-url-copy -rst -p 4  -cc 4 -cd -vb -r -df $STATEFILE gsiftp://srchost/srcdirpath/ gsiftp://dsthost/dstdirpath/; 
     sleep 10; 
     done;
--------


[[gridftp-user-advanced-load-balancing]]
==== Load Balancing ====

When there are multiple GridFTP servers avalibale at endpoints, '-af'
option allows concurrent transfers to be spread across multiple GridFTP
servers rather than multiple connections to a single GridFTP server.

For example, **++globus-url-copy++** can be invoked as shown below:



--------

     globus-url-copy -cc 4 -af /tmp/alias-file -f /tmp/xfer-file
     
--------

Contents of /tmp/alias-file look something like this: 



--------

     @source
     gridftp1.source-cluster.org
     gridftp2.source-cluster.org
     @destination
     gridftp1.destination-cluster.org
     gridftp2.destination-cluster.org
     gridftp3.destination-cluster.org
     gridftp4.destination-cluster.org
     
--------

[NOTE]
--
Each line should either be an alias (noted with the @ symbol), or a
hostname[:port]. Currently, only the aliases @source and @destination
are valid, and they are used for every source or destination url. 

--
Contents of /tmp/xfer-file look something like this: 



--------

     gsiftp:///tmp/x1 gsiftp:///tmp/x1
     gsiftp:///tmp/x2 gsiftp:///tmp/x2
     gsiftp:///tmp/x3 gsiftp:///tmp/x3
     gsiftp:///tmp/x4 gsiftp:///tmp/x4
     
--------

[NOTE]
--
The host part in the url is ignored. 

--
In the above example, the following transfers will happen concurrently: 



--------

     gsiftp://gridftp1.source-cluster.org/tmp/x1 gsiftp://gridftp1.destination-cluster.org/tmp/x1
     gsiftp://gridftp2.source-cluster.org/tmp/x2 gsiftp://gridftp2.destination-cluster.org/tmp/x2
     gsiftp://gridftp1.source-cluster.org/tmp/x3 gsiftp://gridftp3.destination-cluster.org/tmp/x3
     gsiftp://gridftp2.source-cluster.org/tmp/x4 gsiftp://gridftp4.destination-cluster.org/tmp/x4
     
--------


[[gridftp-user-advanced-udt]]
==== Using UDT as an alternative transport protocol for TCP ====

UDT is an application-level protocol that uses UDP for data transport.
It addresses some of the limitations of TCP in high-bandwidth and
high-delay networks and achieves better performance than TCP on those
networks. To use UDT as the underlying transport protocol for the
GridFTP transfers, use the '-udt' option.

[NOTE]
--
Note: In order to use this for a third-party transfer, the server must
be configured to
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-config-udt[enable UDT]. In
order to use this for a client-server transfer, you need to enable
multi-threading in **++globus-url-copy++**. To switch to threaded
flavor, set the environment variable 'GLOBUS_THREAD_MODEL=pthread'. 

--

[[gridftp-user-advanced-encryption]]
==== Encryption and Integrity protection ====

The data channel is authenticated by default. Integrity protection and
encryption are optional. To integrity protect the data, use the
'-dcsafe' option. For encrypted data transfer, use the '-dcpriv' option.


[[gridftp-user-advanced-striping]]
==== Striping ====

The striping functionality enables one to use a set of computers at both
ends of a network to transfer data. At both the source and destination
ends, the computers need to have a shared file system so that the
dataset is accessible from any computer.

This feature is especially useful in configurations where individual
nodes at the source and destination clusters have significantly less
network capacity when compared to the network capacity available between
the clusters. An example would be clusters with the individual nodes
connected by 1 Gbit/s Ethernet connections to a switch that is itself
connected to the external network at 10 Gbit/s or faster.

To perform striped data movement, use the '-stripe' option. 

[NOTE]
--
This option is useful only if the server is
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-striped[configured for
striped data movement].

[[gridftp-user-advanced-bottleneck]]
==== Bottleneck detection ====

To determine whether the disk or the network is the bottleneck for the
file transfer, use the '-nlb' option. This option uses NetLogger to
estimate speeds of disk and network read/write system calls, and attempt
to determine the bottleneck component.

[NOTE]
--
In order to use this, the server must be configured to
http://www.cedps.net/index.php/Gridftp-netlogger[enable netlogger
bottleneck detection].

--
Example: 

--------
globus-url-copy -p 2 -nlb -vb  gsiftp://host1:port/path/myfile gsiftp://host2:port/path/myfile
--------


This will output something like the following:



--------

     Total instantaneous throughput:
     disk read    = 17022.2 Mbits/s
     disk write   = 26630.8 Mbits/s
     net read     = 509.0 Mbits/s
     net write    = 1053.4 Mbits/s
     Bottleneck: network

[[globus-url-copy-interactiveclients]]
=== Interactive clients for GridFTP ===

The Globus Project does **not** provide an interactive client for
GridFTP. Any normal FTP client will work with a GridFTP server, but it
cannot take advantage of the advanced features of GridFTP. The
interactive clients listed below take advantage of the advanced features
of GridFTP.

There is no endorsement implied by their presence here. We make no
assertion as to the quality or appropriateness of these tools, we simply
provide this for your convenience. We will **not** answer questions,
accept bugs, or in any way shape or form be responsible for these tools,
although they should have mechanisms of their own for such things. 

UberFTP was developed at the NCSA under the auspices of NMI and
