Last Update: August 2005

Working with Los Alamos National Laboratory and the High Performance
Storage System (HPSS) collaboration
(http://www.hpss-collaboration.org[http://www.hpss-collaboration.org]),
we have written a Data Storage Interface (DSI) for read/write access to
HPSS. This DSI would allow an existing application that uses a GridFTP
compliant client to utilize an HPSS data resources.

This DSI is currently in testing. Due to changes in the HPSS security
mechanisms, it requires HPSS 6.2 or later, which is due to be released
in Q4 2005. Distribution for the DSI has not been worked out yet, but it
will *probably* be available from both Globus and the HPSS
collaboration. While this code will be open source, it requires
underlying HPSS libraries which are NOT open source (proprietary). 

[NOTE]
--
This is a purely server side change, the client does not know what DSI is running, so only a site that is already running HPSS and wants to allow GridFTP access needs to worry about access to these proprietary libraries.
