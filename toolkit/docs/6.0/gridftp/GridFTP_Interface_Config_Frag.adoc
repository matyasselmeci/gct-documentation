=== GridFTP server configuration overview ===
indexterm:[configuring GridFTP][overview]

The configuration interface for GridFTP is the admin tool, , which can
be used with a configuration file and/or run-time options.

[NOTE]
--
Command line options and configuration file options may both be used,
but the command line **overrides** the config file.

--
The configuration file for the GridFTP server is read from the following
locations, in the given order. Only the first file found will be loaded:

* Path specified with the ++-c <configfile>++ command line option.

* ++$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf++

* ++/etc/grid-security/gridftp.conf++



Options are one per line, with the format: 

--------
<option> <value>
--------
If the value contains spaces, they should be enclosed in double-quotes
("). Flags or boolean options should only have a value of 0 or 1. Blank
lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.

For example: 

--------
  port 5000
  allow_anonymous 1
  anonymous_user bob
  banner "Welcome!"
      
--------


For complete command documentation including all options, see .

This page includes information about general configuration of the
GridFTP server. Security options are discussed
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-config-security[here],
and more advanced configuration is described
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-advanced[here].


[[gridftp-config-types]]
=== Typical configuration ===
indexterm:[configuring GridFTP,typical]

The following describes a typical GridFTP configuration of the front end
(control channel) and back end (data channels). For other alternatives
that provide greater levels of security, see
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-advanced[Advanced
Configuration].

By default, the data channel and control channel are separate socket
connections within the same process. The client sends a command and
waits to finish before issuing the next command. This is good for a
single host, traditional-type user. If you have a single host and you
want an ultra-reliable and light weight file transfer service, this is a
good choice. This configuration is also good for testing purposes.


[[gridftp-config-security-firewalls]]
=== Firewall requirements ===

If the GridFTP server is behind a firewall:



. Contact your network administrator to open up port 2811 (for GridFTP
control channel connection) and a range of ports (for GridFTP data
channel connections) for the incoming connections. If the firewall
blocks the outgoing connections, open up a range of ports for outgoing
connections as well.

. Set the environment variable GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE: 
+
--------
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=min,max 
--------
where 'min','max' specify the port range that you have opened for the
incoming connections on the firewall. This restricts the listening ports
of the GridFTP server to this range. Recommended range is 1000 (e.g.,
50000-51000) but it really depends on how much use you expect.

. If you have a firewall blocking the outgoing connections and you have
opened a range of ports, set the environment variable
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE: 
+
--------
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=min,max 
--------
where 'min','max' specify the port range that you have opened for the
outgoing connections on the firewall. This restricts the GridFTP server
to bind to a local port in this range for outbound connections.
Recommended range is twice the range used for GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE,
because if parallel TCP streams are used for transfers, the listening
port would remain the same for each connection but the connecting port
would be different for each connection.


[NOTE]
--
If the server is behind NAT, the ++--data-interface <real ip/hostname>++
option needs to be used on the server.

[[gridftp-admin-config-security]]
=== Configuring Security for GridFTP ===

There are many security options in GridFTP ranging from no security to
higher security via GSI .


[[gridftp-admin-config-security-anonymous]]
==== Anonymous mode ====
indexterm:[configuring GridFTP,security,anonymous]

Anonymous mode (using the '-aa' option) allows any user with an FTP
client to read and write (and delete) files that the server process can
similarly access (it is also a quick way to test that your server
works).



--------
globus% globus-gridftp-server -aa
Server listening at 127.0.0.1:58806
--------

[WARNING]
--
When the server is run in this way, anyone who can connect to the server
will posses all the same rights as the user that the process is run as
(directly or via '-anonymous-user'). If using this mode intentionally
for open access, it is best to run under a dedicated account with
limited filesystem permissions. You can also use the option below to
disable FTP commands such as STOR, ESTO, DELE, RDEL, RNTO, etc to make
sure that users can only read from the server and not write to it. 

--------
 -disable-command-list <string>
--------
Where <string> represents a comma separated list of client commands that
will be disabled. Default: not set. 

--

[[gridftp-admin-config-security-userpw]]
==== Username/password ====
indexterm:[configuring GridFTP,security,username/password]

If you trust your network and want a minimal amount of security, you can
run the globus-gridftp-server with clear text passwords. This security
model is the one originally introduced in RFC959.

[WARNING]
--
We do not recommend it for long running servers open to the internet.

--

===== Create password file =====

To run the server in clear text password mode, we first need to create a
password file dedicated to it. The format of the password file is the
same as standard system password files; however, it is ill-advised to
use a system password file. To create an entry in a GridFTP password
file, run the following commands:



--------
globus% touch pwfile
globus% gridftp-password.pl >> pwfile
Password:
--------

This will ask you for a password and then create an entry in the
password file for the current user name and the given password. Take a
look at the file created. You will notice that the password you typed in
is not in the file in a clear text form. We have run it though a one way
hash algorithm before storing it in the file.


===== Run the server in password mode =====

Simply start the server pointing it at the password file you just
created.



--------
globus% globus-gridftp-server -password-file  /full/path/of/pwfile
Server listening at 127.0.0.1:5555
--------


===== Make a transfer =====

To run globus-url-copy with the password, use the following syntax:



--------
globus% globus-url-copy file:///etc/group ftp://
--------


[[gridftp-admin-config-security-sshftp]]
==== SSHFTP (GridFTP-over-SSH) ====
indexterm:[configuring GridFTP,security,over SSH]

This type of security introduces the sshftp control channel (frontend)
protocol. This is a very simple means of obtaining strong security on
the control channel only (the data channel is **not** authenticated).
With this approach, you can run a GridFTP transfer anywhere that you can
ssh. ++sshftp://++ leverages the ubiquitous ssh/sshd programs to form
control channel connections much in the same way that inetd forms
connections. leverages the ubiquitous ssh/sshd programs to form control
channel connections much in the same way that inetd forms connections.


===== Configure Server for SSH GridFTP Support =====

Every host that wishes to run a **++globus-gridftp-server++** which can
accept ++sshftp://++ connections must run the following command as root:
connections must run the following command as root:



--------
globus% globus-gridftp-server-enable-sshftp
--------

In the absence of root access, a user can configure the server to allow
++sshftp://++ connections for that user only with the following command:
connections for that user only with the following command:



--------
globus% globus-gridftp-server-enable-sshftp -nonroot
--------

The above command creates a file named 'sshftp' in '/etc/grid-security'
(if run as root) or in '$HOME/.globus' (if run as nonroot). You may edit
this file to set gridftp commandline options or environment variables
such as GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE, but you can also set those options in the
config file. 


===== Performing ++sshftp://++ Transfers Transfers =====

In this case, a **++globus-gridftp-server++** does not need to be
running. The server will be started via the sshd program. Therefore, the
hostname and port should be that of the sshd server. Run
**++globus-url-copy++** just as you have before; simply change
++ftp://++ to  to ++sshftp://++..



--------
globus% globus-url-copy -v file:/etc/group sshftp://127.0.0.1/tmp/group
globus% globus-url-copy -list sshftp://127.0.0.1/tmp/
--------


[[gridftp-admin-gsiftp]]
==== GSIFTP ====
indexterm:[configuring GridFTP,security,gsiftp]

This security option can be the most involved to set up, but provides
the most security. It requires setting up GSI security as described in
the GT Installation Guide here:
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-basic-security[Basic Security
Configuration]. 

Once GSI has been set up (host and user credentials are valid, the
gridmap file is updated and you've run grid-proxy-init to create a proxy
certificate), you simply run the GridFTP server:



--------
globus-gridftp-server
--------

[NOTE]
--
If run as ++root++, it will pick up the host cert; if not, it will pick
up the user cert.

--
Now you are ready to perform a GSI-authenticated transfer:



--------
globus-url-copy <-s subject> src_url dst_url
--------

[NOTE]
--
The subject option is only needed if the server was not started as root.

--

[[gridftp-admin-daemon_mode]]
===== Running in daemon mode =====
indexterm:[admin scenarios,running in daemon mode]

The server should generally be run as root in daemon mode, although it
is possible to run it as a user (see below). When run as root you will
need to have a
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-basic-host[host
certificate].

Run the server:



--------
globus-gridftp-server < -s | -S > <args>
--------

where:



**-s**::
     Runs in the foreground (this is the default mode).

**-S**::
     Detaches from the terminal and runs in the background.


The following additional steps may be required when running as a user
other than root (for more details, review
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-basic-security[Basic Security
Configuration]): 

* Create a ++~/.gridmap++ file, containing the DNs of any clients you wish to allow, mapped to the current username. file, containing the DNs of any clients you wish to allow, mapped to the current username.

* Create a proxy with **++grid-proxy-init++**.




[[gridftp-admin-inetd]]
===== Running under inetd or xinetd =====
indexterm:[deploying,running under inetd or xinetd]

[NOTE]
--
We also feature a user-configurable, super-server daemon plugin called
GFork. Click
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-gfork-master[here] for
more information.
--

. Set up xinetd/inetd config file
+
[NOTE]
--
The service name used (gsiftp in this case) should be defined in
++/etc/services++ with the desired port.
--
+
Here is a sample GridFTP server xinetd config entry in
++/etc/xinetd.conf++: : 
+
--------
service gsiftp
{
    instances               = 100
    socket_type             = stream
    wait                    = no
    user                    = root
    env                     += GLOBUS_LOCATION=(globus_location)
    env                     += LD_LIBRARY_PATH=(globus_location)/lib
    server                  = (globus_location)/sbin/globus-gridftp-server
    server_args             = -i
    log_on_success          += DURATION
    nice                    = 10
    disable                 = no
}
--------
+
Here is a sample gridftp server inetd config entry in
++/etc/inetd.conf++ (read as a single line)
+
--------
gsiftp   stream   tcp   nowait   root   /usr/bin/env env    \
GLOBUS_LOCATION=(globus_location)                           \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=(globus_location)/lib                       \ 
(globus_location)/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -i
--------
+
[NOTE]
--
On Mac OS X, you must set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH
in the above examples. 
--
+
[NOTE]
--
You should NOT include USERID in the log lines. See
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-troubleshooting-latency[High
latency for GridFTP server connections] for more information.
--
+
. globus-gridftp-server -i
+
Use the '-i' commandline option with **++globus-gridftp-server++**: 
+
--------
globus-gridftp-server -i
--------


[[gridftp-admin-launchd]]
===== Running under launchd =====

launchd is used to start services in the system Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)
and newer, and is also available as a port to FreeBSD.

Here is a
http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/{$shortversion}/{$version}/gridftp/globus.gridftp.plist[sample]
configuration file for launchd to start the server:



--------

include::globus.gridftp.plist[]


--------

Provided that the configuration file is stored in
++/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/globus.gridftp.plist++, the following
command starts the GridFTP server:, the following command starts the
GridFTP server:



--------
launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/globus.griftp.plist
--------

The server will be started automatically with a system, unless the value
of the key 'Disabled' is changed from **++<false/>++** to
**++<true/>++**.


[[gridftp-admin-user-pems]]
==== User permissions ====

Users are mapped to a local account on the server machine and file
permissions are handled by the operating systems. In the anonymous mode,
users that connect to the server will posses all the same rights as the
user that the server process is run as (directly or via
-anonymous-user).

In case of username/password authentication, the users are mapped to the
uid corresponding to the username in the GridFTP password file and the
access permissions for the users is same as that of the UID that they
are mapped to. If SSH based authentication is used, upon successful
authentication, SSHD maps users to a local account and the GridFTP
server is run as the mapped local user. The access permissions are the
same as that of the mapped local user.

If GSI is used, upon successful authentication an authorization callout
is invoked to (a) verify authorization and (b) determine the local user
id as which the request should be executed. This callout is linked
dynamically. Globus GridFTP provides an implementation that supports a
Globus "gridmapfile". Sites can also provide alternative
implementations. Server does a setuid to the local user id as determined
by the authorization callout and the access permissions are the same as
that of the local user id.

GridFTP server provides an option to disable certain FTP commands: 

--------
 -disable-command-list <string>
--------
Where <string> represents a comma separated list of client commands that
will be disabled. Default: not set.


=== **++globus-gridftp-server++** quickstart ===

The following is a quick guide to running the server and using the
client:

Look through the list of options for globus-gridftp-server:



--------
globus-gridftp-server --help
--------

Start the server in anonymous mode (discussed more fully
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-config-security-anonymous[here]):



--------
globus-gridftp-server -control-interface 127.0.0.1 -aa -p 5000
--------

where: 

**–control-interface**::
     is the hostname or IP address of the interface to listen for control connections on . This option is only needed here as a rudimentary means of security for this simple example.

**–aa**::
     enables anonymous mode

**–p**::
     indicates on which port the server listens.


Run a two party transfer with client:



--------
globus-url-copy -v file:///etc/group ftp://localhost:5000/tmp/group
--------

Run 3rd party transfer:



--------
globus-url-copy -v ftp://localhost:port/etc/group ftp://localhost:port/tmp/group2
--------

Experiment with -dbg, and -vb options for debugging and checking the
performance of your setup:



--------
globus-url-copy -dbg file:///etc/group ftp://localhost:5000/tmp/group
--------



--------
globus-url-copy -vb file:///dev/zero ftp://localhost:5000/dev/null
--------

where:



** -dbg**::
     A useful option when something is not working. It results in a GridFTP
control channel protocol dump (along with other useful information) to
stderr. If you understand the GridFTP protocol, or you have ambition to
understand it, this can be a very useful tool to discover various
problems in your setup such as overloaded servers and firewalls. When
submitting a bug report or asking a question on the support email lists
one should always send along the -dbg output.

**-vb**::
     Provides a type of progress bar of the user to observe the rate at which
their transfer is progressing.


Ctrl-c - Kill the server.

[NOTE]
--
There are many possible options and configurations with
**++globus-gridftp-server++**. For some guidelines on setting it up for
your situation, see
link:../../gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp-admin-tuning[Key Admin Settings and
Tuning Recommendations].

=== Enabling File Sharing with Globus Sharing Service ===

To enable file sharing using
https://www.globus.org/researchers/plus-plans[Globus Sharing], you have
to add the link:../securityd2b.tar.gz[Globus Sharing CA certificates] to
your trusted certificates directory (/etc/grid-security/certificates)
and use '-sharing-dn' option in the server as follows: 

--------
globus% globus-gridftp-server -sharing-dn "/C=US/O=Globus Consortium/OU=Globus Online/OU=Transfer User/CN=__transfer__"

--------
and use '-sharing-rp' option to restrict the file paths allowed for
sharing: 

--------
globus% globus-gridftp-server -sharing-rp <path> 

--------
