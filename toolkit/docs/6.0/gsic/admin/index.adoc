.Introduction
--
This guide contains advanced configuration information for system
administrators working with GSI C. It provides references to information
on procedures typically performed by system administrators, including
installation, configuring, deploying, and testing the installation.

The security tools are installed as part of the Globus Toolkit
installation process. For instructions on basic installation of the
Globus Toolkit, see the link:../../admin/install/index.html[Globus Toolkit
Installation Guide].

Authentication in the Globus Toolkit is based on X.509 certificates.
This document describes the configuration steps required to:

* determine whether or not to trust certificates issued by a particular
  Certificate Authority (CA),
* provide appropriate default values for use by the **++grid-cert-request++**
  command, which is used to generate certificates, 
* request service certificates, used by services to authenticate themselves to
  users, and 
* specify identity mapping information.
