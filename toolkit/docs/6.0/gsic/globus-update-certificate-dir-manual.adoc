== NAME ==
globus-update-certificate-dir - Update symlinks in the trusted CA directory

== SYNOPSIS ==
**++globus-update-certificate-dir++** [++-help++ ] [++-d++ 'DIRECTORY'] 

== Description ==

The **++globus-update-certificate-dir++** program creates symlinks
between files (CA certificates, certificate revocation lists, signing
policy, and certificate request configuration files) using the
certificate hash the installed version of OpenSSL uses. OpenSSL 1.0.0
uses a different name hashing algorithm than previous versions, so CA
distributions created with older versions of OpenSSL might not be able
to locate trusted CAs and related files. Running
**++globus-update-certificate-dir++** against a trusted CA directory
will add symlinks to the files to the hash if needed. 

The full set of command-line options to
**++globus-update-certificate-dir++** consists of: 

**-help**::
     Display a help message to standard output and exit

**-d 'DIRECTORY'**::
     Create links in the trusted CA directory 'DIRECTORY' instead of using the default search path.



== Environment ==

If the following variables affect the execution of
**++globus-update-certificate-dir++** 

**++X509_CERT_DIR++**::
     Default trusted certificate directory.

**++HOME++**::
     Path to the current user's home directory.

**++GLOBUS_LOCATION++**::
     Path to the Globus installation.
