.Credential and Gridmap Errors
|=======================================================================
| Error Code | Definition | Possible Solutions
| ++Your proxy credential may have expired++ | Your proxy credential may have expired.
| Use link:../../gsic/pi/index.html#grid-proxy-info[**++grid-proxy-info++**] to
  check whether the proxy credential has actually expired.  If it has, generate
  a new proxy with 
  link:../../gsic/pi/index.html#grid-proxy-init[**++grid-proxy-init++**].
  
| ++The system clock on either the local or remote system is wrong.++
| This may cause the server or client to conclude that a credential has expired.
| 
Check the system clocks on the local and remote system.
  
| ++Your end-user certificate may have expired++
| Your end-user certificate may have expired
| Use link:../../gsic/pi/index.html#grid-cert-info[**++grid-cert-info++**] to
check your certificate's expiration date.  If it has expired, follow your CA's
procedures to get a new one.
| ++The permissions may be wrong on your proxy file++
| If the permissions on your proxy file are too lax (for example, if others can read your proxy file), Globus Toolkit clients will not use that 
   file to authenticate. 
| You can "fix" this problem by changing the permissions on the file or by
destroying it (with 
link:../../gsic/pi/index.html#grid-proxy-destroy[**++grid-proxy-destroy++**]) and creating a new one (with 
link:../../gsic/pi/index.html#grid-proxy-init[**++grid-proxy-init++**]).
+
**Important**: However, it is still possible that someone else has made a copy
of that file during the time that the permissions were wrong. In that case,
they will be able to impersonate you until the proxy file expires or your
permissions or end-user certificate are revoked, whichever happens
first.
| ++The permissions may be wrong on your private key file++
| If the permissions on your end user certificate private key file are too lax
(for example, if others can read the file), grid-proxy-init will refuse to
create a proxy certificate. 
| You can "fix" this by changing the permissions on the private key file. 
+
**Important:** However, you will still have a much more serious problem: 
it's possible that someone has made a copy of your private key file. Although
this file is encrypted, it is possible that someone will be able to decrypt the
private key, at which point they will be able to impersonate you as long as
your end user certificate is valid.  You should contact your CA to have your
end-user certificate revoked and get a new one.
  
| ++The remote system may not trust your CA++
| The remote system may not trust your CA
| Verify that the remote system is configured to trust the CA that issued your
  end-entity certificate. See the link:../../admin/install.html[admin guide]
  for details.
| ++You may not trust the remote system's CA++
| You may not trust the remote system's CA
| Verify that your system is configured to trust the remote CA (or that your
  environment is set up to trust the remote CA). See  the
  link:../../admin/install.html[Admin Guide] for details.
| ++There may be something wrong with the remote service's credentials++
| There may be something wrong with the remote service's credentials
| It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between errors reported by the
  remote service regarding your credentials and errors reported by the client
  interface regarding the remote service's credentials. If you can't find
  anything wrong with your credentials, check for the same conditions on the
  remote system (or ask a remote administrator to do so) .
  
| ++The content of the grid map file does not conform to the expected format++
| The content of the grid map file does not conform to the expected format
| Run
link:../../gsic/index.html#grid-mapfile-check-consistency[**++grid-mapfile-check-consistency++**]
to make sure that your gridmap file conforms to the expected format.
  
| ++The grid map file does not contain a entry for your DN++
| The grid map file does not contain a entry for your DN
| Use link:../../gsic/pi/index.html#grid-mapfile-add-entry[**++grid-mapfile-add-entry++**] to add the relevant entry.
