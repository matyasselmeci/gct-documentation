The Globus Toolkit GSI C component provides APIs and tools for
authentication, authorization and certificate management. The
authentication API is built using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
technologies, e.g. X.509 Certificates and TLS. In addition to
authentication it features a delegation mechanism based upon X.509 Proxy
Certificates. Authorization support takes the form of a couple of APIs.
The first provides a generic authorization API that allows callouts to
perform access control based on the client's credentials (i.e. the X.509
certificate chain). The second provides a simple access control list
that maps authorized remote entities to local (system) user names. The
second mechanism also provides callouts that allow third parties to
override the default behavior and is currently used in the Gatekeeper
and GridFTP servers. In addition to the above there are various lower
level APIs and tools for managing, discovering and querying
certificates.
