GSI-OpenSSH is a modified version of OpenSSH that adds support for X.509
proxy certificate authentication and delegation, providing a single
sign-on remote login and file transfer service. GSI-OpenSSH can be used
to login to remote systems and transfer files between systems without
entering a password, relying instead on a valid proxy credential for
authentication. GSI-OpenSSH forwards proxy credentials to the remote
system on login, so commands requiring proxy credentials (including
GSI-OpenSSH commands) can be used on the remote system without the need
to manually create a new proxy credential on that system. For more
information about GSI-OpenSSH, see the
