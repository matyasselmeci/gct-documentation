=== GSI-OpenSSH usage statistics collection ===

By default, the GSI-OpenSSH server (sshd) will send a UDP packet
containing usage information to usage-stats.cilogon.org:4810 after
serving each request. See the
http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/ssh/privacy.html[Privacy Policy] for
details. You can see the Globus Usage Statistics policy
link:/toolkit/docs/latest-stable/Usage_Stats.html[here].
