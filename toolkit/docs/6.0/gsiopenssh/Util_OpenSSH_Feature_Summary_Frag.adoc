=== Feature summary ===


***********************************************************************
Supported Features

* The **++gsissh++** command provides a secure remote login service with forwarding of X.509 proxy credentials.

* The **++gsiscp++** and **++gsisftp++** commands provide a secure file transfer service authenticated with X.509 proxy credentials, mimicking the **++rcp/scp++** and **++ftp/sftp++** commands.

* All standard OpenSSH features are supported, excluding Kerberos authentication. Kerberos authentication is **not** compatible with GSI-enabled OpenSSH.

* The GSI-OpenSSH server can replace the standard system SSH server in typical environments.

* If no username is given on the command-line, GSI-OpenSSH automatically determines the username that corresponds to the X.509 proxy certificate subject in the server's ++grid-mapfile++.

Deprecated Features

* None
