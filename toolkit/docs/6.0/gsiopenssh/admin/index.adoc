.Introduction
--
This guide contains advanced configuration information for system
administrators working with GSI-OpenSSH. It provides references to
information on procedures typically performed by system administrators,
including installation, configuring, deploying, and testing the
installation.
[IMPORTANT]
--
This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite,
overview, installation, security configuration instructions in
link:../../admin/install/index.html[Installing GT 6.0]. Read through this guide
before continuing!
--

This guide is meant solely to cover the GSI aspects of GSI-OpenSSH, and
is not meant to be a full manual for OpenSSH itself. Please refer to the
http://www.openssh.org/[OpenSSH Home Page] for general documentation for
OpenSSH.

== Building and Installing ==


--
GSI-OpenSSH is built and installed as part of a default GT 6.0
installation. For basic installation instructions, see
link:../../admin/install/index.html[Installing GT 6.0]. No extra installation
steps are required for this component. 


--

[[gsiopenssh-admin-installing-configure-options]]
=== Optional Build-Time Configuration ===

You can optionally pass build-time configure options to the GSI-OpenSSH
package using the --with-gsiopensshargs option when running configure
for your GT 6.0 installation. For example:

***********************************************************************


--------
./configure
--prefix=$HOME/globus 
     
--with-gsiopensshargs="--with-pam"
--------


***********************************************************************

No options are typically needed for client-only installations, but
options are often needed for full server functionality. The following
lists suggested options for different platforms. 

**Linux**::
     ++--with-pam --with-md5-passwords --with-tcp-wrappers++

**Solaris**::
     ++--with-pam --with-md5-passwords --with-tcp-wrappers++++


[NOTE]
--
Note: If you enable PAM support with the --with-pam configuration
option, be sure to also set "UsePAM yes" in
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/ssh/sshd_config after installation. 

--
If you have an already configured and installed system-wide SSHD and you
would like your build of GSI-OpenSSH to behave similarly, investigate
the configure options available in GSI-OpenSSH and select those options
that would add the functionality that your current SSHD possesses. Be
aware that since GSI-OpenSSH is based on OpenSSH, the standard set of
functionality is turned on by default. 

**Please do not attempt to override the following options:** 



--------

 --prefix
 --sysconfdir
 --with-globus
 --with-globus-flavor
 --with-ssl-dir

--------


[[gsiopenssh-admin-installing-openssh-only]]
=== Building and Installing only GSI-OpenSSH ===

If you wish to install GSI-OpenSSH without installing the rest of the
Globus Toolkit, follow the instructions in
link:../../admin/install/index.html[Installing GT 6.0] with the following
changes.
First, you do not need Ant, a JDK, or a JDBC database to build only
GSI-OpenSSH. Second, instead of running "make", run: 



--------
globus$ make gsi-openssh
--------

This will install the GSI-OpenSSH client and server programs. For
client-only installations, simply do not configure or use the installed
server.

[[gsiopenssh-admin-deploying]]
== Deploying ==


--
. To install the GSI-Enabled OpenSSH Server on most systems, you must be a
privileged user, such as root. 
+
--------
sh$ /bin/su - root 
--------
Note: If your system functions like this and you attempt to run these
commands as a user other than root, these commands should fail.

. (optional) Start a copy of your system's currently running SSH server on
an alternate port by running, eg. 
+
--------

sh# /usr/sbin/sshd -p 2000 &

--------
You may then choose to log in to this server and continue the rest of
these steps from that shell. We recommend doing this since some sshd
shutdown scripts do particularly nasty things like killing **all** of
the running SSH servers on a system, not just the parent server that may
be listening on port 22. Roughly translated, this step is about
guaranteeing that an alternate method of access is available should the
main SSH server be shutdown and your connection via that server be
terminated.

. Locate your server's startup/shutdown script directory. On some systems
this directory may be located at /etc/rc.d/init.d, but since this
location is not constant across operating systems, for the purposes of
this document we will refer to this directory as INITDIR. Consult your
operating system's documentation for your system's location.

. Run the following command. 
+
--------

sh# mv $INITDIR/sshd $INITDIR/sshd.bak

--------

. Either copy or link the new sshd script to your system's
startup/shutdown script directory. 
+
--------

sh# cp $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXsshd $INITDIR/sshd

--------

. Shutdown the currently running main SSH server. 
+
--------

sh# $INITDIR/sshd.bak stop

--------

. Provided you still have a connection to the machine, start the new SSH
server. 
+
--------

sh# $INITDIR/sshd start

--------

. Test the new server by connecting to the standard SSH port (22) and
authenticating via multiple methods. Especially test that GSI
authentication works correctly.

. If you are performing a new install, or if the old server was not
configured to be started at run-time and shutdown automatically at
system halt or reboot, either use a system utility such as RedHat's
chkconfig to configure the system for the correct run-levels, or
manually link up the correct run-levels. 
+
--------

sh# /sbin/chkconfig sshd reset

--------
The recommended run-levels are listed in a set of comments within the
SXXsshd startup script. For example, on standard Unix systems we
recommend running the GSI-Enabled OpenSSH server in run-levels two,
three, four, and five.

. Finally, if, as a precautionary measure, you started a SSH server on an
alternate port in order to complete the install process, you can now
safely stop all instances of that server.



--
 
[[gsiopenssh-admin-testing]]
== Testing ==


--
. Edit the file $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXsshd so that the GSI-Enabled
OpenSSH server starts up on an alternate port.

. Run the command 
+
--------

sh# $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXsshd start

--------
and verify that the server is running by checking that it both shows up
in a process listing and creates a file named
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/var/sshd.pid.

. From a remote machine attempt to connect to the local server on the
modified test port using the standard SSH authentication methods plus
authenticating via your GSI credentials. This may require you to
authorize these users via an appropriate entry in the grid-mapfile.

. Stop the SSH server by running the command 
+
--------

sh# $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/SXXsshd stop

--------
and reverse any changes you made that altered the port on which the
server resided upon startup. After this step, running SXXsshd start
should start the server on the default port (22).
