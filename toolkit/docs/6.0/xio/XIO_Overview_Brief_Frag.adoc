Globus XIO is an extensible input/output library written in C for the
Globus Toolkit. It provides a single API (open/close/read/write) that
supports multiple wire protocols, with protocol implementations
encapsulated as drivers. The XIO drivers distributed with 6.0 include
TCP, UDP, file, HTTP, GSI, GSSAPI_FTP, TELNET and queuing. In addition,
Globus XIO provides a driver development interface for use by protocol
developers. This interface allows the developer to concentrate on
writing protocol code rather than infrastructure, as XIO provides a
framework for error handling, asynchronous message delivery, timeouts,
etc. The XIO driver-based approach maximizes the reuse of code by
supporting the notion of a driver stack. XIO drivers can be written as
atomic units and stacked on top of one another. This modularization
provides maximum flexibility and simplifies the design and evaluation of
individual protocols.
