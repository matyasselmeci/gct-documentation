=== Security considerations for XIO ===

Globus XIO is a framework for creating network protocols. Several
existing protocols, such as TCP, come built into the framework. XIO
itself introduces no known security risks. However, all network
applications expose systems to the risks inherent when outsiders can
connect to them. Also included in the XIO distribution is the GSI
driver, which provides a driver that allows for secure connections.
