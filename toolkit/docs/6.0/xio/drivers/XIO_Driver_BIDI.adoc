=== Bidirectional Driver ===

The BIDI driver, bi-directional driver allows a user to turn a
unidirectional pipe, into a bidirectional stream. It does this simply by
opening up 1 uni-directional pipe in each direction. By default it
assumes the use of the ModeE driver, but it can be configured to use any
driver.
