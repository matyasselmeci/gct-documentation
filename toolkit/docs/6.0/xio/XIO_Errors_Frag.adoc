.XIO Errors
|=======================================================================
| Error Code | Definition | Possible Solutions
| ++Operation was canceled++
| An I/O operation has been canceled by a close or a cancel
| In most cases this will be intentionally performed by the
  application developer.  In unexpected cases the applciation
  developer should verify that there is not a race condition
  relating to closing a handle.

| ++Operation timed out++
| Occurs when the application developer associates a timeout with
  a handle's I/O operations.  If no I/O is performed before the
  timeout expires this error will be triggered.
|  The remote side of connection might be hung and busy.  The network
   could have higher latencies than expected.  The filesystem might
   be over worked.

| ++An end of file occurred++
| This occurs when and EOF is detected on the file descriptor
| When doing file I/O this like means you read to the end of the file
  and thus you are finished and should now close it.  On network
  connections however it means the socket was closed on the remote
  end.  This can happen it the remote side suddenly dies (seg-fault
  is common here) or if the remote side chooses to close the connection.

| ++Contact string invalid++
| A poorly formed contact string was passed in to open
| Verify the format of the contact string with the documentation of
  the drivers in use.

| ++Memory allocation failed on XXXX++
| malloc failed.  The system is likely quite overloaded
| Free up memory in your application

| ++ System error in XXXX++
| A low level system error occurred.  The errno and errstring should
    indicate more information.
| 

| ++Invalid stack++
| The requested stack does not meet XIO standards
| Most likely a transport driver is not on the bottom of the stack,
  or 2 transport drivers are in the stack.

| ++Operation already registered++
| With certain common drivers like TCP and FILE, only one specific
  operations can be registered at a time (1 read, 1 write).  If
  another operation of the same type is posted to the handle before
  receiving the previous operations callback, this error can occur.
| Restructure the application code so that it waits for the callback
  before registering the next IO operation.

| ++Unexpected state++
| The internal logic of XIO came across a logical path that should
  not be possible.  Often times this is due to application memory
  corruption or trying to perform an IO operation on a closed or
  otherwise invalid handle.
| Use valgrind or some sort of memory managment tool to verify there
  is no memory corruption.  Try to recreate the problem in a small 
  program.  Submit the program and the memory trace to the
  http://jira.globus.org[Globus bug tracker].

| ++Driver in handle has been unloaded++
| A driver associated with the offending operation has already been
  unloaded by the application code.
| Verify that you are not unloading drivers until they are no longer
  in use.

| ++Module not activated++
| globus_module_activate(GLOBUS_XIO_MODULE); has not been called.
| Call this before making any other XIO API calls.
