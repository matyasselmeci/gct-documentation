[[gtadmin-makefile]]
=== The makefile ===

You do not have to build every subcomponent of this release. The
makefile specifies subtargets for different functional subpieces. 




* gram: GRAM5

* gridftp: GridFTP


Note that all of these targets require the "install" target also. So,
for instance, to build GridFTP alone, you would run: 

--------

$ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install
$ make gridftp install

--------



=== Linking with Globus Toolkit Libraries ===

Since GT 2.0, the toolkit has included a script called
globus-makefile-header that can be used to assemble the cflags and link
line information when linking a program with libraries included in the
toolkit. This script would walk the package metadata dependency tree to
ensure that all needed flags were included, without duplicates. This
method worked, and continues to work in GT 6.0, but we consider it to be
obsolete, as we have added support for using link:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config[pkg-config] 

Pkg-config is very similar in concept to globus-makefile-header, but it
has gained widespread adoption across a range of unix platforms. 

To get the cflags and link line information to link to the
globus-ftp-client library, for example, you could 

--------
$ pkg-config --cflags --libs globus-ftp-client
--------


Each Globus Toolkit library has a pkg-config metadata file that is
installed as part of its devel package. 

For more information about pkg-config, please see
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config[the pkg-config
homepage.]
