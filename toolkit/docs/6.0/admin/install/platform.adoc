Configure libtool with the configuration option
**++--program-prefix=g++** to cause the libtool script to be named
**++glibtool++** to avoid conflicts with the OS X libtool program which
provides different functionality than GNU libtool. Install libtool (and
the other tools) into the a common directory. If you do so, you'll need
to set the ++LIBTOOLIZE++ environment variable to the path to the
**++glibtoolize++** program. You'll need to include the autotools in
your path to regenerate the configurable scripts and Makefile.in files
for the toolkit. 

The Globus Toolki build requires the **++pkg-config++** package to be
installed. It is available from
http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/[freedesktop.org].
Additionally, you'll need to set the environment variable
++PKG_CONFIG_PATH++ to ++/usr/lib/pkgconfig++ prior to running the
configure script.  prior to running the configure script.
