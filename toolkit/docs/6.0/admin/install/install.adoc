[[install-toolkit]]
==== Installing the Toolkit on Linux ====

The components of the toolkit can be installed separately, or all at
once. This section will show how to install various components, on both
RPM based and Debian based Linux systems.

For Fedora or Red Hat-based systems, used the **++yum++** command to
install the Globus components and their dependencies. For SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server systems, use **++zypper++**. For Debian-based systems,
used the **++apt-get++** or **++aptitude++** commands. 

For example, to install the GridFTP client tools, do the following for
RPM-based systems: 

--------
root# yum install globus-data-management-client
--------
Do the following for Debian-based systems: 

--------
root# apt-get install globus-data-management-client
--------



[[install-packagegroups]]
===== Package Groups =====

The Globus Toolkit distribution includes several high-level package
groups that can be used to install multiple packages to enable full
client or server functionality of some Globus Toolkit component.

These packages are: 

**++globus-gridftp++**::
     GridFTP client and server tools

**++globus-gram5++**::
     GRAM5 client and server tools

**++globus-gsi++**::
     Globus Security Infrastructure tools for managing certificates and proxies

**++globus-data-management-server++**::
     Server tools for deploying a GridFTP server.

**++globus-data-management-client++**::
     Client Tools for data management, including the GridFTP client programs and globus-url-copy

**++globus-data-management-sdk++**::
     Development headers and documentation for writing applications using the GridFTP APIs.

**++globus-resource-management-server++**::
     Server tools for deploying a GRAM5 resource manager

**++globus-resource-management-client++**::
     Client tools for resource management, including the globusrun tool, and the globus-job-* tools.

**++globus-resource-management-sdk++**::
     Development headers and documentation for writing applications using the GRAM5 APIs.



===== Updating a Globus Installation =====

In GT 6, there are three Globus Toolkit package repositories:
**Stable**, **Testing**, and **Unstable**. The **Stable** repository is
enabled by default, and is updated to to include fixes for major bugs
and security issues. These can be easily installed via **++yum++** or
**++apt-get++**. These updates will be published in the
http://www.globus.org/toolkit/rss/advisories/{$shortversion}.rss[GT].
Also, this means that when the next point release is made, collecting
other minor bug fixes, the upgrade can be done via **++yum++** or
**++apt-get++** without installing a new repository definition package. 

In addition, users may enable the **Testing** or **Unstable** package
repositories. These have different levels of documentation and testing
done to them. 

The **Testing** repository contains packages which have passed our
automated test suite and are made available to people who are interested
in the latest bug fixes. These packages will likely be migrated to the
**Stable** repository once the package has been verified to fix a bug or
issue and the documentation has been updated to include informtion about
the issue. 

The **Unstable** repository contains packages which have compiled
successfully, but may not have completed all tests or are experimental
in some way. Packages from the **Unstable** will potentially make it to
the **Testing** repository once they seem to be functional. 


==== Installing the Toolkit on Mac OS X ====

Download the Mac OS X Globus Toolkit Installation Package from the
Globus Toolkit web site. Click on ++globus_toolkit-6.0.pkg++, and follow
the installation instructions. If you select the "Install for me only"
option, your , and follow the installation instructions. If you select
the "Install for me only" option, your ++$HOME/.profile++ is modified to
add the Globus Toolkit components to your path. If you are using a
different shell, you may need to incorporate those changes into your
shell initialization file. If you install for all users, the global path
will be updated.  is modified to add the Globus Toolkit components to
your path. If you are using a different shell, you may need to
incorporate those changes into your shell initialization file. If you
install for all users, the global path will be updated. 

To uninstall the toolkit, run the **++globus-uninstall++** script which
will remove the toolkit and revert the PATH changes. 


==== Installing the Toolkit on Windows ====

There are four options when installing the Globus Toolkit on Windows:
either using cygwin (32- and 64- bit builds) or MingW (32- and 64- bit
builds). 

The Cygwin installation requires the cygwin runtime (either 32-bit or
64-bit) to be installed: see http://www.cygwin.com[cygwin.com] for
details. To use the Globus Toolkit on cygwin, download the
globus_toolkit-6.0-x86_64-pc-cygwin.zip or To use the Globus Toolkit on
cygwin, download and unzip the globus_toolkit-6.0-i386-pc-cygwin.zip
file and in the cygwin root directory. This will create files in
/opt/globus 

The mingw installtion does not require a special runtime, but some parts
of the toolkit do not work with it: (LIST PENDING). To install the MingW
packages, download the globus_toolkit-6.0-x86_64-w64-mingw32.zip or To
use the Globus Toolkit on cygwin, download and unzip the
globus_toolkit-6.0-i386-w64-mingw32.zip file. Add the unzipped
directory's Globus\bin and Globus\sbin paths to your PATH environment to
be able to use the Globus Toolkit.

==== Installing from Source Installer ====



. Create a user named **++globus++**. This non-privileged user will be
used to perform administrative tasks, deploying services, etc. Pick an
installation directory, and make sure this account has read and write
permissions in the installation directory.
+
[TIP]
--
You might need to create the target directory as **++root++**, then
chown it to the **++globus++** user: 

--------
root# mkdir 
root# chown globus:globus 
--------


--
+
[IMPORTANT]
--
If for some reason you do **not** create a user named **++globus++**, be
sure to run the installation as a **non-root** user. In that case, make
sure to pick an install directory that your user account has write
access to. 

--

. Download the required software noted in link:#gtadmin-prereq[Software
Prerequisites].

. The Globus Toolkit Source Installer sets the installation directory by
default to ++/usr/local/globus-6++, but you may replace , but you may
replace ++/usr/local/globus-6++ with whatever directory you wish to
install to, by setting the prefix when you configure. with whatever
directory you wish to install to, by setting the prefix when you
configure.

Note that this command can take a while to complete. If you wish to have
a log file of the build, use **++tee++**:
+
--------
globus% make 2>&1 | tee build.log
--------
+
The syntax above assumes a Bourne shell. If you are using another shell,
redirect stderr to stdout and then pipe it to **++tee++**.

. To test the toolkit, or particular packages within the toolkit, run: 
+
--------
globus% make check
--------
+
or 
+
--------
globus% make COMPONENT-check
--------
+
where 'COMPONENT' is the name of the package to test. As an example, you
could run 
+
--------
globus% make globus_gssapi_gsi-check
--------
+
to run the GSSAPI test programs.

. Finally, run:
+
--------
globus% make install
--------
+
This completes your installation. Now you may move on to the
configuration sections of the following chapters.
