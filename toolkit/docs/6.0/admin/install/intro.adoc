This guide is the starting point for everyone who wants to install
Globus Toolkit 6.0. It will take you through a basic installation that
installs the following basic services: a security infrastructure (GSI),
GridFTP, and Execution Services (GRAM5). 
This guide is also available as a link:installingGT.pdf[PDF]. However,
each component includes online reference material, which this guide
sometimes links to.
