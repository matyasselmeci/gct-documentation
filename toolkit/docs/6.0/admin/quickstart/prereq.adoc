[[q-prereq]]
=== Prerequisites ===

We distribute the Globus Toolkit 6 as a set of RPM and Debian packages
for Linux systems, as an installable package for Mac OS X, as a .zip
file for Windows and Cygwin, as well as a source installer which can be
used on other operating systems. In this quickstart, we will be
installing RPM packages. Thus, it is a prerequisite for following this
quickstart that you are running a distribution for which we provide
RPMs. If you are running a supported Debian or Ubuntu system, the
process is very similar, but you'll need to use the **++apt-get++** or
similar tools to install the packages. For the source installer, there
is more work involved, and you'll need to consult the full installation
guide. 

First, we will to set up our system to use the Globus package
repository. This repository contains the Globus software packages,
signed by our build manager. We provide RPM and Debian packages that
contain a source configuration file and the public key which can be used
to verify the packages. If your distribution has Globus 6.0 packages
within its repository, you can skip to the next section. 

The globus toolkit package repo RPM can be downloaded from
http://www.globus.org/ftppub/gt6/installers/repo/globus-toolkit-repo-latest.noarch.rpm[the
repo RPM package on globus.org]. 

To install binary RPMs, download the globus-toolkit-repo package from
the link above and install it with the command: 

--------
root# rpm -hUv globus-toolkit-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
--------


The globus toolkit package repo Debian file can be downloaded from
http://www.globus.org/ftppub/gt6/installers/repo/globus-toolkit-repo%5flatest%5fall.deb[the
repo Debian package on globus.org]. 

To install Debian or Ubuntu package, download the globus-toolkit-repo
package from the link above and install it with the command: 

--------
root# dpkg -i globus-toolkit-repo_latest_all.deb
--------


Once you've installed the Globus repository package, you can use your
operating system's packaging tools: **++yum++** or **++apt-get++**, to
install the Globus components.

For operating systems based on RHEL (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
CentOS, and Scientific Linux), the compatible EPEL repository must be
enabled before installing myproxy. For OS versions 5.x, install the
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm[EPEL
5 package], and for OS version 6.x, use
http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-7.noarch.rpm[6
package]. 
For information about installing these, see the
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How%5fcan%5fI%5finstall%5fthe%5fpackages%5ffrom%5fthe%5fEPEL%5fsoftware%5frepository.3F[EPEL
FAQ]. 
This step is not needed for Fedora, Debian, or Ubuntu systems.

For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server systems which will be using
globus-connect-server, a newer version of apache2 must be installed in
order for myproxy-oauth to work. This is available by adding the Apache2
and Apache2 Modules for SLES11 repositories from opensuse.org. 
These can be installed by running these commands: 

--------
root# zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache/SLE_11_SP3/Apache.repo
root# zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/Apache_SLE_11_SP3/Apache:Modules.repo
root# rpm --import http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache/SLE_11_SP3/repodata/repomd.xml.key
root# rpm --import http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/Apache_SLE_11_SP3/repodata/repomd.xml.key
