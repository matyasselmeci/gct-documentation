== Usage statistics collection by the Globus Alliance ==


[[gram5-usage-stats]]
=== GRAM5-specific usage statistics ===

The following usage statistics are sent by default in a UDP packet (in
addition to the GRAM component code, packet version, timestamp, and
source IP address) at the end of each job. 

* Job Manager Session ID

* dryrun used

* RSL Host Count

* Timestamp when job hit ++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_UNSUBMITTED++

* Timestamp when job hit ++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_FILE_STAGE_IN++

* Timestamp when job hit ++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_PENDING++

* Timestamp when job hit ++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_ACTIVE++

* Timestamp when job hit ++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_FAILED++

* Timestamp when job hit ++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_FILE_STAGE_OUT++

* Timestamp when job hit ++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_DONE++

* Job Failure Code

* Number of times status is called

* Number of times register is called

* Number of times signal is called

* Number of times refresh is called

* Number of files named in file_clean_up RSL

* Number of files being staged in (including executable, stdin) from http servers

* Number of files being staged in (including executable, stdin) from https servers

* Number of files being staged in (including executable, stdin) from ftp servers

* Number of files being staged in (including executable, stdin) from gsiftp servers

* Number of files being staged into the GASS cache from http servers

* Number of files being staged into the GASS cache from https servers

* Number of files being staged into the GASS cache from ftp servers

* Number of files being staged into the GASS cache from gsiftp servers

* Number of files being staged out (including stdout and stderr) to http servers

* Number of files being staged out (including stdout and stderr) to https servers

* Number of files being staged out (including stdout and stderr) to ftp servers

* Number of files being staged out (including stdout and stderr) to gsiftp servers

* Bitmask of used RSL attributes (values are 2^id from the gram5_rsl_attributes table)

* Number of times unregister is called

* Value of the ++count++ RSL attribute

* Comma-separated list of string names of other RSL attributes not in the set defined in ++globus-gram-job-manager.rvf++

* Job type string

* Number of times the job was restarted

* Total number of state callbacks sent to all clients for this job



The following information can be sent as well in a job status packet but
it is not sent unless explicitly enabled by the system administrator: 

* Value of the executable RSL attribute

* Value of the arguments RSL attribute

* IP adddress and port of the client that submitted the job

* User DN of the client that submitted the job



In addition to job-related status, the job manager sends information
periodically about its execution status. The following information is
sent by default in a UDP packet (in addition to the GRAM component code,
packet version, timestamp, and source IP address) at job manager start
and every 1 hour during the job manager lifetime: 

* Job Manager Start Time

* Job Manager Session ID

* Job Manager Status Time

* Job Manager Version

* LRM

* Poll used

* Audit used

* Number of restarted jobs

* Total number of jobs

* Total number of failed jobs

* Total number of canceled jobs

* Total number of completed jobs

* Total number of dry-run jobs

* Peak number of concurrently managed jobs

* Number of jobs currently being managed

* Number of jobs currently in the UNSUBMITTED state

* Number of jobs currently in the STAGE_IN state

* Number of jobs currently in the PENDING state

* Number of jobs currently in the ACTIVE state

* Number of jobs currently in the STAGE_OUT state

* Number of jobs currently in the FAILED state

* Number of jobs currently in the DONE state
