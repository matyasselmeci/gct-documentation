== RSL Specification v1.1 ==

--

This is a document to specify the existing RSL v1.0 implementation and
interfaces, as they are provided in the GT 6.0 release. This document
serves as a reference, and more introductory text.


The Globus Resource Specification Language (RSL) provides a common
interchange language to describe resources. The various components of
the Globus Resource Management architecture manipulate RSL strings to
perform their management functions in cooperation with the other
components in the system. The RSL provides the skeletal syntax used to
compose complicated resource descriptions, and the various resource
management components introduce specific ''ATTRIBUTE'',''VALUE''>
pairings into this common structure. Each attribute in a resource
description serves as a parameter to control the behavior of one or more
components in the resource management system.

[[gram5-rsl-syntax-overview]]
=== RSL Syntax Overview ===

The core syntax of the RSL syntax is the **relation**. Relations
associate an attribute name with a value, eg the relation
++executable=a.out++ provides the name of an executable in a resource
request. There are two generative syntactic structures in the RSL that
are used to build more complicated resource descriptions out of the
basic relations: **compound requests** and **value sequences**. In
addition, the RSL syntax includes a facility to both introduce and
dereference string **substitution variables**. 


The simplest form of compound request, utilized by all resource
management components, is the conjunct-request. The conjuct-request
expresses a conjunction of simple relations or compound requests (like a
boolean AND). The most common conjunct-request in Globus RSL strings is
the combination of multiple relations such as executable name, node
count, executable arguments, and output files for a basic GRAM job
request. Similarly, the core RSL syntax includes a disjunct-request form
to represent disjunctive relations (like a boolean OR). Currently,
however, no resource management component utilizes the disjunct-request
form. 


The last form of compound request is the multi-request. The
multi-request expresses multiple parallel resources that make up a
resource description. The multi-request form differs from the
conjunction and disjunction in two ways: multi-requests introduce new
variable scope, meaning variables defined in one clause of a
multi-request are not visible to the other clauses, and multi-requests
introduce a non-reducible hierarchy to the resource description. Whereas
relations within a conjunct-request can be thought of as **constraints**
on the resource being described, the subclauses of a multi-request are
best thought of as individual resource descriptions that together
constitute an abstract resource collection; the same attributes may be
**constrained** in different ways in each subclause without causing a
logical contradiction. An example of a contradiction would be to
constrain the ++executable++ attribute to be two conflicting values
within a conjunction. Currently, however, no resource management
component utilizes the disjunct-request form. 


The simplest form of value in the RSL syntax is the string literal. When
explicitly quoted, literals can contain any character, and many common
literals that don't contain special characters can appear without
quotes. Values can also be variable references, in which case the
variable reference is in essence **replaced** with the string value
defined for that variable. RSL descriptions can also express
string-concatenation of values, especially useful to construct long
strings out of several variable references. String concatenation is
supported with both an explicit concatenation operator and implicit
concatenation for many idiomatic constructions involving variable
references and literals. 


In addition to the simple value forms given above, the RSL syntax
includes the value sequence to express ordered sets of values. The value
sequence syntax is used primarily for defining variables and for
providing the argument list for a program. 


[[gram5-rsl-tokenization-overview]]
=== RSL Tokenization Overview ===

Each RSL string consists of a sequence of RSL tokens, whitespace, and
comments. The RSL tokens are either special syntax or regular unquoted
literals, where special syntax contains one or more of the following
listed special characters and unquoted literals are made of sequences of
characters excluding the special characters. 


The complete set of special characters that cannot appear as part of an
unquoted literal is: 

* +++++ (plus)
* ++&++ (ampersand)
* ++|++ (pipe)
* ++(++(left paren)
* ++)++ (right paren)
* ++=++ (equal)
* ++<++ (left angle)
* ++>++ (right angle)
* ++!++ (exclamation)
* ++"++ (double quote)
* ++'++ (apostrophe)
* ++^++ (carat)
* ++#++ (pound)
* ++$++ (dollar)

These characters can only be used for the special syntactic forms
described in the section and in the section or as within quoted
literals. 


Quoted literals are introduced with the ++"++ (double quote) or ++'++
(single quote/apostrophe) and consist of all the characters up to (but
not including) the next solo double or single quote, respectively. To
escape a quote character within a quoted literal, the appearance of the
quote character twice in a row is converted to a single instance of the
character and the literal continues until the next solo quote character.
For any quoted literal, there is only one possible escape sequence, eg
within a literal delimited by the single quote character only the single
quote character uses the escape notation and the double quote character
can appear without escape. 


Quoted literals can also be introduced with an alternate **user
delimiter** notation. User delimited literals are introduced with the
++^++ (carat) character followed immediately by a user-provided
delimiter; the literal consists of all the characters after the user's
delimiter up to (but not including) the next solo instance of the
delimiter. The delimiter itself may be escaped within the literal by
providing two instances in a row, just as the regular quote delimiters
are escaped in regular quoted literals. 


RSL string comments use a notation similar to comments in the C
programming language. Comments are introduced by the prefix `(*`.
Comments continue to the first terminating suffix `*)` and cannot be
nested. Comments are stripped from the RSL string during processing and
are syntactically equivalent to whitespace. 




.Quoted Literal Examples
=======================================================================

Assign the value ++Hello. Welcome to "The Grid"++ to the attribute
++arguments++, using double-quote as the delimiter and the escaping
sequence. 
--------
arguments = "Hello. Welcome to ""The Grid"""
--------


Assign the value ++Hello. Welcome to "The Grid"++ to the attribute
++arguments++ using the single-quote delimiter. 
--------
arguments = 'Hello. Welcome to "The Grid'
--------


Assign the value ++Hello. Welcome to "The Grid"++ to the attribute
++arguments++ using a user-defined quoting character ++!++. 
--------
arguments = ^!Hello. Welcome to "The Grid"!
--------

[[gram5-rsl-substitution-semantics]]
=== RSL Substitution Semantics ===

RSL strings can introduce and reference string variables. String
substitution variables are defined in a special relation using the
++rsl_substitution++ attribute, and the definitions affect variable
references made in the same conjunct-request (or disjunct-request), as
well as references made within any multi-request nested inside one of
the clauses of the conjunction (or disjunction). Each multi-request
introduces a new variable scope for each subrequest, and variable
definitions do not escape the closest enclosing scope. 


Within any given scope, variable definitions are processed left-to-right
in the resource description. Outermost scopes are processed before inner
scopes, and the definitions in inner scopes augment the inherited
definitions with new and/or updated variable definitions. 


Variable definitions and variable references are processed in a single
pass, with each definition updating the **environment** prior to
processing the next definition. The value provided in a variable
definition may include a reference to a previously-defined variable.
References to variables that are not yet provided with definitions in
the standard RSL variable processing order are replaced with an empty
literal string. 


[[gram5-rsl-attribute-summary]]
=== RSL Attribute Summary ===

The RSL syntax is extensible because it defines structure without too
many keywords. Each Globus resource management component introduces
additional attributes to the set recognized by RSL-aware components, so
it is difficult to provide a complete listing of attributes which might
appear in a resource description. Resource management components are
designed to utilize attributes they recognize and pass unrecongnized
relations through unchanged. This allows powerful compositions of
different resource management functions. 


The following listing summarizes the attribute names utilized by
existing resource management components in the standard Globus release.
Please see the individual component documentation for discussion of the
attribute semantics.

[[gram5-rsl-examples]]
=== Simple RSL Examples ===

The following are some simple example RSL strings to illustrate
idiomatic usage with existing tools and to make concrete some of the
more interesting cases of tokenization, concatenation, and variable
semantics. These are meant to illustrate the use of the RSL notation
without much regard for the specific details of a particular resource
management component. 


Typical GRAM5 resource descriptions contain at least a few relations in
a conjunction:




.GRAM5 Job Request Examples
=======================================================================

This example shows a conjunct request containing values that are
unquoted literals and ordered sequences of a mix of quoted and unquoted
literals. 
--------
(* this is a comment *)
& (executable = a.out (* <-- that is an unquoted literal *))
  (directory  = /home/nobody )
  (arguments  = arg1 "arg 2")
  (count = 1)
--------


This example demonstrates RSL substitutions, which can be used to make
sure a string is used consistently multiple times in a resource
description: 
--------

& (rsl_substitution  = (TOPDIR  "/home/nobody")
                       (DATADIR $(TOPDIR)"/data")
                       (EXECDIR $(TOPDIR)/bin) )
  (executable = $(EXECDIR)/a.out
        (* ^-- implicit concatenation *))
  (directory  = $(TOPDIR) )
  (arguments  = $(DATADIR)/file1 
        (* ^-- implicit concatenation *)
                $(DATADIR) # /file2
        (* ^-- explicit concatenation *)
                '$(FOO)'            (* <-- a quoted literal *))
  (environment = (DATADIR $(DATADIR)))
  (count = 1)
--------


Performing all variable substitution and removing comments yields an
equivalent RSL string: 
--------

& (rsl_substitution  = (TOPDIR "/home/nobody")
                       (DATADIR "/home/nobody/data") 
                       (EXECDIR "/home/nobody/bin") )
  (executable = "/home/nobody/bin/a.out" )
  (directory  = "/home/nobody" )
  (arguments  = "/home/nobody/data/file1"
                "/home/nobody/data/file2"
                "$(FOO)" )
  (environment = (DATADIR "/home/nobody/data"))
  (count = 1)
--------


Note in the above variable-substitution example, the variable
substitution definitions are not automatically made a part of the job's
environment. And explicit ++environment++ attribute must be used to add
environment variables for the job. Also note that the third value in the
arguments clause is not a variable reference but only quoted literal
that happens to contain one of the special characters.

[[gram5-rsl-grammar-and-tokenization-rules]]
=== RSL grammar and tokenization rules ===

The following is a modified BNF grammar for the Resource Specification
Language. Lexical rules are provided for the implicit concatenation
sequences in the form of conventional regular expressions; for the
**implicit-concat** non-terminal rules, whitespace is not allowed
between juxtaposed non-terminals. Grammar comments are provided in
square brackets in a column to the right of the productions, eg
++[comment]++ to help relate productions in the grammar to the
terminology used in the above discussion. 


Regular expressions are provided for the terminal class
++string-literal++ and for RSL comments. These regular expression make
use of a common inverted character-class notation, as popularized by the
various **++lex++** tools. Comments are syntactically equivalent to
whitespace and can only appear where the comment prefix cannot be
mistaken for the trailing part of a multi-character unquoted literal.
