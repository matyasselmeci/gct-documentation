.Overview
--
The Globus Toolkit provides GRAM5: a service to submit, monitor, and
cancel jobs on Grid computing resources. In GRAM, a job consists of a
computation and, optionally, file transfer and management operations
related to the computation. Some users, particularly interactive ones,
benefit from accessing output data files as the job is running.
Monitoring consists of querying and/or subscribing for status
information, such as job state changes. 
Grid computing resources are typically managed by a local resource
manager which implements allocation and prioritization policies while
optimizing the execution of all submitted jobs for efficiency and
performance according to site policy. GRAM is not a resource scheduler,
but rather a protocol engine for communicating with a range of different
local resource schedulers using a standard message format.

== Conceptual details ==


--
A number of concepts underly the purpose and motivation for GRAM. These
concepts are divided into broad categories below. 


--

=== Targeted job types ===

GRAM is meant to address a range of jobs where arbitrary programs,
reliable operation, stateful monitoring, credential management, and file
staging are important. GRAM is not meant to serve as a "remote procedure
call" (RPC) interface for applications not requiring many of these
features. Furthermore, its interface model and implementation may be too
costly for such uses. The GRAM5 service protocols and implementation
will always involve multiple round-trips to support these advanced
features that are not required for simple RPC applications. 


=== Component architecture ===

Rather than consisting of a monolithic solution, GRAM is based on a
component architecture at both the protocol and software implementation
levels. This component approach serves as an ideal which shapes the
implementation as well as the abstract design and features. 



Service model::
    For GRAM5, the **++globus-gatekeeper++** daemon and GSI library are used
    for secure communications and service dispatch.
+
The **++globus-job-manager++** daemon implements the job management and
file transfer functionality.

Local Resource Manager Adapters::
    GRAM provides a scripted plug-in architecture to enable extension with
    adapters to control a variety of local resource systems.


=== Security ===



Secure operation::
    GRAM5 uses SSL-based protocols to establish identity or provide other
    security tokens needed to authorize GRAM5 service requests. Once
    authorized, each instance of the job service runs as a local POSIX user.
    GRAM5 restricts job monitoring and management operations to those who are
    authorized by the local site policy.
Local system protection domains::
    To protect users from each other, the GRAM5 job manager and the jobs it
    starts are executed in separate local security contexts. Additionally, GRAM
    mechanisms used to interact with the local resource are designed to
    minimize the privileges required and to minimize the risks of service
    malfunction or compromise.
Credential delegation and management::
    A client delegates some of its rights to the GRAM service in order to allow
    it to perform file transfers on behalf of the client and send state
    notifications to registered clients. Additionally, GRAM5 provides per-job
    credentials so that job instances may perform further authentication with
    other services.
Audit::
    GRAM uses a range of audit and logging techniques to record a history of
    job submissions and critical system operations. These records may be used
    to assist with accounting functions as well as to further mitigate risks
    from abuse or malfunction.
