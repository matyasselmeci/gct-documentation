== Configuring GRAM5 ==


--
GRAM5 is designed to be usable by default without any manual
configuration. However, there are many ways to customize a GRAM5
installation to better interact with site policies, filesystem layouts,
LRM interactions, logging, and auditing. In addition to GRAM5-specific
configuration, see
link:../../gsic/admin/index.html#gsic-configuring[Configuring GSI]
for information about configuring GSI security.

=== Gatekeeper Configuration ===

The **++globus-gatekeeper++** has many configuration options related to
network configuration, security, logging, service path, and nice level.

**Debian Package**::
     ++/etc/default/globus-gatekeeper++

**GLOBUS_GATEKEEPER_NICE_LEVEL**::
     Process nice level for **++globus-gatekeeper++** and **++globus-job-manager++** processes. If not set, the default system process nice level is used.


After modifying the configuration file, restart the
**++globus-gatekeeper++** using the methods described in
link:../../gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-admin-starting-and-stopping[Starting
and Stopping GRAM5 services]. 


[[gram5-configuring-seg]]
=== Scheduler Event Generator Configuration ===

The **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** has several configuration
options related to filesystem paths. This configuration is located in: 

**RPM Package**::
     ++/etc/sysconfig/globus-scheduler-event-generator++

**Debian Package**::
     ++/etc/default/globus-scheduler-event-generator++

**Source Installer**::
     'PREFIX'++/etc/globus-scheduler-event-generator.conf++


The following configuration variables are available in the
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** configuration file: 

**GLOBUS_SEG_PIDFMT**::
     Scheduler Event Generator PID file path format. Modify this to be the location where the **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** writes its process IDs (one per configured LRM). The format is a ++printf++ format string with one ++%s++ to be replaced by the LRM name. By default, **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** uses ++/var/run/globus-scheduler-event-generator-%s.pid++..

**GLOBUS_SEG_LOGFMT**::
     Scheduler Event Generator Log path format. Modify this to be the location where **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** writes its event logs. The format is a ++printf++ format string with one ++%s++ to be replaced by the LRM name. By default, **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** uses ++/var/lib/globus/globus-seg-%s++. If you modify this value, you'll need to also update the LRM configuration file to look for the log file in the new location.. If you modify this value, you'll need to also update the LRM configuration file to look for the log file in the new location.

**GLOBUS_SEG_NICE_LEVEL**::
     Process nice level for **++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** processes. If not set, the default system process nice level is used.


After modifying the configuration file, restart the
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** using the methods described in
link:../../gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-admin-starting-and-stopping[Starting
and Stopping GRAM5 services].


[[gram5-configuring-jobmanager]]
=== Job Manager Configuration ===

The **++globus-job-manager++** process is started by the
**++globus-gatekeeper++** and uses the configuration defined in the
service entry for the resource name. By default, these service entries
use a common configuration file for most job manager features. This
configuration is located in: 

RPM Package::
    ++/etc/globus/globus-gram-job-manager.conf++
Debian Package::
    ++/etc/globus/globus-gram-job-manager.conf++
Source Installer::
    'PREFIX'++/etc/globus-gram-job-manager.conf++


This configuration file is used to construct the command-line options
for the **++globus-job-manager++** program. Thus, all of the options
described in link:#gram5-cmd-globus-job-manager[globus-job-manager] may be
used. 


==== Job Manager Logging ====

From an administrator's perspective, the most important job manager
configuration options are likely the ones related to logging and
auditing. The default GRAM5 configuration puts logs in
++/var/log/globus/gram_USERNAME.log++, with logging enabled at the ,
with logging enabled at the ++FATAL++ and ++ERROR++ levels. To enable
more fine-grained logging, add the option '-log-levels ' to
++/etc/globus/globus-gram-job-manager.conf++. The value for . The value
for 'LEVELS' is a set of log levels joined by the ++|++ character. The
available log levels are:

[[gram5-log-levels]]
[options='header']
.GRAM5 Log Levels
|=======================================================================
| Level | Meaning | Default Behavior
| ++FATAL++
| Problems which cause the job manager to terminate prematurely.
| Enabled
| ++ERROR++
| Problems which cause a job or operation to fail.
| Enabled
| ++WARN++
| Problems which cause minor problems with job execution or monitoring.
| Disabled
| ++INFO++
| Major events in the lifetime of the job manager and its jobs.
| Disabled
| ++DEBUG++
| Minor events in the lifetime of jobs.
| Disabled
| ++TRACE++
| Job processing details.
| Disabled
|=======================================================================


In RPM or Debian package installs, these logs will be configured to be
rotated via **++logrotate++**. See
++/etc/logrotate.d/globus-job-manager++ for details on the default log
rotation configuration.  for details on the default log rotation
configuration. 


==== Firewall Configuration ====

There are also a few configuration options related to the TCP ports the
the Job Manager users. This port configuration is useful when dealing
with firewalls that restrict incoming or outgoing ports. To restrict
incoming ports (those that the Job Manager listens on), add the
command-line option '-globus-tcp-port-range' to the Job Manager
configuration file like this: 

--------
-globus-tcp-port-range MIN-PORT,MAX-PORT
--------
Where 'MIN-PORT' is the minimum TCP port number the Job Manager will
listen on and 'MAX-PORT' is the maximum TCP port number the Job Manager
will listen on. 

Similarly, to restrict the outgoing port numbers that the job manager
connects form, use the command-line option '-globus-tcp-source-range',
like this: 

--------
-globus-tcp-source-range MIN-PORT,MAX-PORT
--------
Where 'MIN-PORT' is the minimum outgoing TCP port number the Job Manager
will use and 'MAX-PORT' is the maximum TCP outgoing port number the Job
Manager will use. 

For more information about Globus and firewalls, see
link:../../admin/install/index.html#gt-admin-firewall[Firewall configuration].


[[gram5-configuring-lrm]]
=== LRM Adapter Configuration ===

Each LRM adapter has its own configuration file which can help customize
the adapter to the site configuration. Some LRMs use non-standard
programs to launch parallel or MPI jobs, and some might want to provide
queue or project validation to make it easier to translate job failures
into problems that can be described by GRAM5. All of the LRM adapter
configuration files consist of simple ++variable="value"++ pairs, with a
leading ++#++ starting a comment until end-of-line. 

Generally, the GRAM5 LRM configuration files are located in the globus
configuration directory, with each configuration file named by the LRM
name (++fork++, ++condor++, ++pbs++, ++sge++, or ++slurm++). The
following are the paths to these configurations: 

RPM Package::
    ++/etc/globus/globus-++'LRM'++.conf++

     Path to **++mpiexec++** and **++mpirun++** for parallel jobs which use MPI. By default these are not configured. The LRM adapter will use **++mpiexec++** over **++mpirun++** if both are defined.

**qsub, qstat, qdel**::
     Path to the LRM-specific command to submit, check, and delete PBS jobs. These are usually determined when the LRM adapter is compiled if they are in the ++PATH++.

**remote_shell**::
     Remote shell command to launch processes on different nodes when ++cluster++ is set to ++yes++.

configuration parameters:  configuration file can define the following
configuration parameters: 

**sge_root**::
     Root location of the GridEngine installation. If this is set to ++undefined++, then the LRM adapter will try to determine it from the **++globus-job-manager++** environment, or if not there, the contents of the file named by the ++sge_config++ configuration parameter.

**sun_mprun, mpirun**::

**default_pe**::
     Default parallel environment to submit parallel jobs to. If this is not set, then clients must use the ++parallel_environment++ RSL attribute to choose one.

**available_pes**::
     If this value is defined, use it as a list of parallel environments supported by this GridEngine deployment for validation when ++validate_pes++ is set to ++yes++.

===== Enabling reporting for the GridEngine Scheduler Event Generator =====

In order to use the Scheduler Event Generator with GridEngine, the job
reporting feature must be enabled, and ARCo database storage must not be
enabled. To enable this, use the command **++qconf -mconf++** and modify
