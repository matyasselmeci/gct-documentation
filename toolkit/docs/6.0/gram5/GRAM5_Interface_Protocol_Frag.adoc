=== GRAM5 Protocol ===

The GRAM Protocol is used to handle communication between the
Gatekeeper, Job Manager, and GRAM Clients. The protocol is based on a
subset of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, with a small set of message types and
responses sent as the body of the HTTP requests and responses. This
document describes GRAM Protocol version 2 as used by GRAM5. This is
compatible with with the GRAM Protocol parsers in GRAM2 with extensions.



==== Framing ====

GRAM messages are framed in HTTP/1.1 messages. However, only a small
subset of the HTTP specification is used or understood by the GRAM
system. All GRAM requests are HTTP POST messages. Only the following
HTTP headers are understood: 

* Host

* Content-Type (set to "application/x-globus-gram" in all cases)

* Content-Length

* Connection (set to "close" in all HTTP responses)



Only the following status codes are supported in response's HTTP
Status-Line: 

* 200 OK

* 403 Forbidden

* 404 Not Found

* 500 Internal Server Error

* 400 Bad Request




==== Message Format ====

All messages use the carriage return (ASCII value 13) followed by line
feed (ASCII value 10) sequence to delimit lines. In all cases, a blank
line separates the HTTP header from the message body. All
++application/x-globus-gram++ message bodies consist of attribute names
followed by a colon, a space, and then the value of the attribute. When
the value may contain a newline or double-quote character, a special
escaping rule is used to encapsulate the complete string. This
encapsulation consists of surrounding the string with double-quotes, and
escaping all double-quote and backslash characters within the string
with a backslash. All other characters are sent without modification.
For example, the string 

--------
rsl: &( executable = "/bin/echo" )
 ( arguments = "hello" )
--------
becomes 

--------
rsl: "&( executable = \"bin/echo\" )
  (arguments = \"hello\" )"
--------


In GRAM5, protocol extensions are supported in the status update
messages. These extensions are implemented as extra attribute names
**after** all of the attributes defined in the messages below. Older
GRAM protocol parsers will ignore those extensions that occur after the
attributes in the messages defined below. In GRAM5, the following
extensions are used: 

**++exit-code++**::
     Job exit code. Sent in job state callbacks and in job status replies when the job completes.

**++gt3-failure-type++**::
     Failure detail type for staging errors. Sent in job state callbacks and in job status replies when a job fails.

**++gt3-failure-message++**::
     Failure detail message for more context for errors. Sent in job state callbacks and in job status replies when a job fails.

**++gt3-failure-source++**::
     Failure detail message for the source of a failed file transfer. Sent in job state callbacks and in job status replies when a job fails.

**++gt3-failure-destination++**::
     Failure detail message for the destination of a failed file transfer. Sent in job state callbacks and in job status replies when a job fails.

**++version++**::
     Job manager package version. Sent in all messages from the job manager.

**++toolkit-version++**::
     Toolkit release that the job manager is running. Sent in all messages from the job manager.


This is the only form of quoting which ++application/x-globus-gram++
messages support. Use of ++% HEX HEX++ escapes (such as seen in URL
encodings) is not meaningful for this protocol. 


==== Message Types ====


===== Ping Request =====

A ping request is used to verify that the gatekeeper is configured
properly to handle a named service. The ping request consists of the
following: 

--------
POST ping/job-manager-name HTTP/1.1
Host: host-name
Content-Type: application/x-globus-gram
Content-Length: message-size

protocol-version: version

--------


The values of the message-specific strings are 

**'job-manager-name'**::
     The name of the service to have the gatekeeper check. The service name corresponds to one of the gatekeeper's configured grid-services, and is usually of the form "jobmanager-'LRM'".

**'host-name'**::
     The name of the host on which the gatekeeper is running. This exists only for compatibility with the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

**'message-size'**::
     The length of the content of the message, not including the HTTP/1.1 header.

**'version'**::
     The version of the GRAM protocol which is being used. For the protocol defined in this document, the value must be the string "2".



===== Job Request =====

A job request is used to scheduler a job remotely using GRAM. The ping
request consists of the HTTP framing described above with the
request-URI consisting of 'job-manager-name', where 'job-manager name'
is the name of the service to use to schedule the job. The format of a
job request message consists of the following:

This is done optionally by appending the @ symbol and the local user name that the job should be run as to the 'job-manager-name'. If the @ and username are not present, then the first grid map entry will be used. If the client credential is not authorized in the grid map to use the specified account, an authorization error will occur in the gatekeeper.

     The version of the GRAM protocol which is being used. For the protocol defined in this document, the value must be the string ++2++.

**'signal'**::
     A quoted string containing the signal number and its parameters.



===== Job State Updates =====

A job status update message is sent by the job manager to all registered
callback contacts when the job's status changes. The format of the job
status update messages is as follows: 

--------
POST callback-contact HTTP/1.1
Host: host-name
Content-Type: application/x-globus-gram
Content-Length: message-size

protocol-version: version

--------


The values of the emphasized text items are as below: 

**'callback-contact'**::
     The callback contact string registered with the job manager either by being passed as the 'callback-contact' in a job request message or in a callback register message.

**'host-name'**::
     The host part of the callback-contact URL. This exists only for compatibility with the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

**'message-size'**::
     The length of the content of the message, not including the HTTP/1.1 header.

**'version'**::
     The version of the GRAM protocol which is being used. For the protocol defined in this document, the value must be the string ++2++.

**'job-contact'**::
     The job contact of the job which has changed states.



===== Proxy Delegation =====

A proxy delegation message is sent by the client to the job manager to
initiate a delegation handshake to generate a new proxy credential for
the job manager. This credential is used by the job manager or the job
when making further secured connections. The format of the delegation
message is as follows: 

--------
POST callback-contact HTTP/1.1
Host: host-name
Content-Type: application/x-globus-gram
Content-Length: message-size

protocol-version: version
"renew"
--------


If a successful (200) reply is sent in response to this message, then
the client will procede with a GSI delegation handshake. The tokens in
this handshake will be framed with a 4 byte big-endian token length
header. The framed tokens will then be wrapped using the
GLOBUS_IO_SECURE_CHANNEL_MODE_SSL_WRAP wrapping mode. The job manager
will frame response tokens in the same manner. After the job manager
receives its final delegation token, it will respond with another
response message that indicates whether the delegation was processed or
not. This response message is a standard GRAM response message. 


===== Security Attributes =====

The following security attributes are needed to communicate with the
Gatekeeper: 

* Authentication must be done using GSSAPI mutual authentication

* Messages must be wrapped with support for the delegation message. When using Globus I/O, this is accomplished by using the the GLOBUS_IO_SECURE_CHANNEL_MODE_GSI_WRAP wrapping mode.
