The Grid Resource Allocation and Management (GRAM5) component is used to
locate, submit, monitor, and cancel jobs on Grid computing resources.
GRAM5 is not a Local Resource Manager, but rather a set of services and
clients for communicating with a range of different batch/cluster job
schedulers using a common protocol. GRAM5 is meant to address a range of
jobs where reliable operation, stateful monitoring, credential
management, and file staging are important.
