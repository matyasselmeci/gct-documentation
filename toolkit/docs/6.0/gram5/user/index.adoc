GRAM services provide secure, remote job submission to different local
resource
  managers in a Grid environment. This document describes the
features of the GRAM service and an overview of tools to use the
service.

== GRAM5 Overview ==


--
GRAM provides a uniform, remote interface for executing jobs on compute
resources. GRAM jobs consist of file transfers and program execution on
one or more compute elements managed by a local resource manager. The
GRAM client can submit the job and then later poll for its status, or it
can request that the GRAM service notify it when the job changes state
or completes. While the job is executing, the client may send control
messages to the GRAM service to monitor or modify the job. GRAM provides
reliable job submission, job recovery in case of service or client
failures, file staging, and asynchronous notification messages. 

GRAM achieves its uniform interface by implementing a domain-specific
language called the
link:../../gram5/developer/index.html#gram5-rsl[Resource Specification
Language] (RSL) which provides a simple way to express job requirements,
environment, and commands in a specification which is independent of the
local resource manager which will actually execute the job. 

The GRAM protocol is a two-phase protocol, so that when jobs are
submitted to a GRAM service, they will not start until a client has
received a contact handle to the job. The GRAM service will not clean up
a job until it has received acknowledgment from the client that the job
completion state has been received. In the case of transient errors,
GRAM clients can reconnect to the GRAM service to determine job state,
or to update information the job will need to stage output files. 

The GRAM service has been built to work in the presence of client and
service failures without losing state information about jobs. If a
client exits and is restarted, it can request job state information,
update URLs for output files to be staged to, and register a new address
to receive job state callbacks. If a service exits and is restarted, it
will resume processing all existing GRAM jobs from their previous state,
and continue to send state updates to any clients which are registered
for them. 

GRAM provides file staging before and after a job runs, scratch
directory management, and a cache location for common files. File
staging is Grid-aware and access remote storage resources via the
GridFTP, ftp https, http protocols. 

Because the GRAM service implements client callbacks for job state
changes, clients can submit a number of jobs and be notified when each
completes. This allows clients to be more responsive to changes in state
than services which require polling for job completion.

[[gram5-user-client-tools]]
=== GRAM Client Tools ===

There are a number of GRAM clients which can be used to interact with
the GRAM service. The Globus Toolkit includes **++globusrun++**,
**++globus-job-submit++**, and **++globus-job-run++**. Other projects
provide higher-level tools which can be used to manage large sets of
jobs. 


==== Condor-G ====

Condor is a high-throughput job scheduler from the University of
Wisconsin. It provides a facility called Condor-G to run jobs via GRAM.
See the
http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/latest/index.html[Condor
documentation], especially the section on Grid Universe, which describes
how to write Condor Classified Ads to run jobs using GRAM services. The
++gt5++ Grid type provides the best performance for using GRAM with
Condor-G. 


==== Swift ====

The http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/main/[Swift] system from the
University of Chicago is a data-oriented coarse grained scripting
language that supports dataset typing and mapping, dataset iteration,
conditional branching, and procedural composition. The SwiftScript
language can be used to create workflows that are executed on various
services, including GRAM. See the
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/userguide.php[Swift User's
Guide] for information about using Swift. 


==== GridWay ====

The http://www.gridway.org/[GridWay Metascheduler] enables large-scale,
reliable and efficient sharing of computing resources: clusters,
supercomputers, stand-alone servers. It supports different LRM systems
(PBS, SGE, LSF, Condor) within a single organization or scattered across
several administrative domains. The
http://www.gridway.org/doku.php?id=documentation[GridWay] manual
describes how to use GridWay. 


==== GRAM APIs ====

In addition to the tools above, you can write your own GRAM clients,
using the public APIs described in the
link:../../gram5/developer/index.html[GRAM5 Developer's Guide]. The
client APIs there can be used to write custom applications that interact
with GRAM services in C/C++ or Java. 


=== Portals and Science Gateways that use GRAM ===


==== XSEDE ====

https://www.xsede.org[XSEDE] provides a number of domain-specific
https://www.xsede.org/gateways-overview[science gateways and portals],
which provide interfaces to various computation and data resources,
including some managed by GRAM.

These include http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/amp/[CGD's Atmospheric Modeling &
Predictability Section] from NCAR, the
http://uslims.uthscsa.edu[UltraScan LIMS Portal] at the Bioinformatics
Core Facility at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San
Antonio, the https://sidgrid.ci.uchicago.edu[Social Informatics Data
(SID) Grid] at the University of Chicago, and http://scec.org[Southern
California Earthquake Center] headquarted at the University of Southern
California.

== Using GRAM5 ==


[[gram5-user-prepare]]
=== Before Getting Started ===


==== GRAM and Security ====

GRAM uses the link:../../gsic/index.html[Grid Security Infrastructure]
for its security
implementation, based on X.509 certificates and the TLSv1 protocol to
authenticate user identities with GRAM services. Before using GRAM, you
must first obtain a security credential. This is typically done by
requesting a certificate from a site-specific CA, or by using a portal
to obtain a temporary credential. In typical use, GRAM uses a
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3820.txt[proxy certificate] which is a
short-term credential digitally signed by a private key. Please read the
link:../../gsic/user/index.html#gsic-user-basic-procedure[Basic procedure for
using GSI C] to learn more
about how to obtain and use a GSI credential before continuing this
guide. 


[[gram5-user-resource-names]]
==== GRAM Resource Names ====

Before interacting with a GRAM service, you must know its contact
address. GRAM uses a very flexible URL-like syntax to contain
information about the service's hostname, TCP port number, service name,
and security identity. In the basic case, you will only need to use the
service's hostname to contact the service. However, if the service is
configured to run on a non-standard port, or with a custom service name,
or credential which doesn't match its hostname, you will need to use one
of the longer forms. 

A fully-qualified resource name looks something like
++grid.example.org:2120/jobmanager-sge:/C=US/O=Example/OU=Grid/CN=host/grid.example.org++.
Breaking this down, the resource name includes: 

[options='header']
|=======================================================================
| Name Component | Example | Meaning | Default

| Host Name
| ++grid.example.org++
| Host which the GRAM service is running on.
| None. This is always a required component.

| TCP Port
| ++2120++
| TCP port which the GRAM service is listening on. If multiple GRAM services
are running on the same machine, they may use alternate TCP ports.
| ++2119++

| Service Name
| ++jobmanager-sge++
| The name of the GRAM service on the given host. A
host may provide access to multiple resources
using different local resource managers.  This name is used to
distinguish which service to use for a particular job request. Typically, a host
will provide a default entry called ++jobmanager++ which will interface
with a batch computing or high-throughput scheduling system, and another called
++jobmanager-fork++ for simple non-compute jobs.
| ++jobmanager++

| Credential Name
| ++/C=US/O=Example/OU=Grid /CN=host/grid.example.org++
| The name of the credential which the GRAM service is using. This is only
needed if the credential's common name does not match the host name.
| ++host@++'hostname'
|=======================================================================


Any component of the resource name may be omitted, except for the host
name, and defaults will be used. The field separator ++:++ must be
retained when skipping between name components. 


[[gram5-user-submitting-jobs]]
=== Basic Client Interace ===

This section contains the basic command-line interface for interacting
with gram services. For these examples, we will use the GRAM resource
named ++grid.example.org:2119/jobmanager-pbs++. You will need to change
that to resources which you have been granted access. 


==== Batch and Interactive Use ====

The tools **++globus-job-run++** and **++globus-job-submit++** an both
be used to submit jobs to GRAM resources. The difference is that
**++globus-job-run++** will wait until the job terminates before exiting
and prints job standard output and stderr after the job completes, while
**++globus-job-submit++** will submit the job and then exit immediately,
printing the job contact to its standard output stream. The job can be
then polled for status with the **++globus-job-status++** command, its
output can be fetched with the **++globus-job-get-output++** and cleaned
up with the **++globus-job-clean++** command. 


==== Running Basic Jobs with **++globus-job-run++** ====

The **++globus-job-run++** provides a simple blocking command-line
interface to the GRAM service. The **++globus-job-run++** program
submits a job to a GRAM resource and waits for the job to terminate.
After the job terminates, the output and error streams of the job are
sent to the output and error streams of **++globus-job-run++**. Note
that truly interactive jobs are not supported with GRAM. 

The **++globus-job-run++** program has command-line options to control
most aspects of jobs run by GRAM. However, certain behaviors must be
specified by definition of an RSL string containing various job
attributes. A more detailed description about the RSL language is
included on the section on running jobs with **++globusrun++** below. 

The following examples show some of the common command-line options to
**++globus-job-run++**. Full
link:../../gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-cmd-globus-job-run[**++globus-job-run++**
documentation] is available in the link:../../gram5/pi/index.html[GRAM5
public interface guide]. 




.Minimal job using globus-job-run
=======================================================================
The following command line submits a single instance of the
++/bin/hostname++ executable to the resource named by  executable to the
resource named by **++grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs++**. 

--------
%  globus-job-run 
node1.grid.example.org
--------


=======================================================================




.Multiprocess job using globus-job-run
=======================================================================
The following command line submits ten instances of an executable
++/bin/hostname++. The output of the job is the name of the ten hosts
that the job ran on. The . The output of the job is the name of the ten
hosts that the job ran on. The '-np ' option causes
**++globus-job-run++** to run 'COUNT' instances of the executable. 

--------
%  globus-job-run 
node1.grid.example.org
node3.grid.example.org
node2.grid.example.org
node10.grid.example.org
--------


=======================================================================




.Staging an executable file using globus-job-run
=======================================================================
The following command line submits an executable which is local to the
submit machine to the GRAM resource, then executes it. The executable is
removed automatically from the GRAM resource after the job completes.
The '-s' option prior to the executable name causes
**++globus-job-run++** to stage the executable using GASS (an
https-based protocol) from the machine running **++globus-job-run++** to
the GRAM resource. 

--------
%  globus-job-run 
node1.grid.example.org
--------


=======================================================================




.Providing an input file to a job using globus-job-run
=======================================================================
The following command line submits a job to a GRAM resource. When this
job runs, its standard input will read from the file
++$HOME/inputfile.txt++, which is located on the GRAM resource. The ,
which is located on the GRAM resource. The '-stdin' command-line option
indicates this path. 

--------
%  globus-job-run 
Hello, Grid
--------


=======================================================================




.Staging an input file to a job using globus-job-run
=======================================================================
The following command line submits a job to a GRAM resource. When this
job runs, its standard input will read from the file ++inputfile.txt++,
which is located on the submit client machine. The , which is located on
the submit client machine. The '-stdin -s' command-line option
combination causes the input to be staged in the above executable
staging example. 

--------
%  globus-job-run 
Hello, staged input on the Grid
--------


=======================================================================




.Canceling an interactive job
=======================================================================
This example shows how using the  (or other system-specific mechanism
for sending the ++SIGINT++ signal) can be used to cancel a GRAM job. 
--------
%  globus-job-run 

GRAM Job failed because the user cancelled the job (error code 8)
--------

=======================================================================




.Setting job environment variables with globus-job-run
=======================================================================
The following command line submits one instances of the executable
++/usr/bin/env++, setting some environment variables in the job
environment beyond those set by GRAM5. The , setting some environment
variables in the job environment beyond those set by GRAM5. The '-env '
command-line option adds the named variable to the job environment. It
may be present multiple times in the command-line to set multiple
environment variables. 

--------
%  globus-job-run 
HOME=/home/juser
LOGNAME=juser
GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_CONTACT=https://client.example.org:3882/16001579536700793196/5295612977485997184/
GLOBUS_LOCATION=/opt/globus-
--------


=======================================================================


==== Submitting Basic Jobs with **++globus-job-submit++** ====

A related tool to **++globus-job-run++** is
link:../../gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-cmd-globus-job-submit[**++globus-job-submit++**].
This command submits a job to a GRAM5 service then exits without waiting
for the job to terminate. Other tools
(link:../../gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-cmd-globus-job-cancel[**++globus-job-cancel++**],
link:../../gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-cmd-globus-job-clean[**++globus-job-clean++**],
and
link:../../gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-cmd-globus-job-get-output[**++globus-job-get-output++**])
allow futher interaction with the job. 

[IMPORTANT]
--
When using **++globus-job-submit++**, the job output and state will
remain on disk on the GRAM resource until one of
**++globus-job-clean++** or **++globus-job-cancel++** is run for that
job. Be sure to clean up your jobs! 

--
The **++globus-job-submit++** program has most of the same command-line
options as **++globus-job-run++**. When run, instead of displaying the
output and error streams of the job, it prints the job contact, which is
used with the other globus-job tools to interact with the job. 




.globus-job-submit
=======================================================================
This example shows the interaction of submitting a job via
**++globus-job-submit++**, checking its status with
**++globus-job-status++**, getting its output with
**++globus-job-get-output++**, and then cleaning the job with
**++globus-job-clean++**. Note that this example uses the
++jobmanager-fork++ service when retrieving input and cleaning the job.
This allows those tasks to be done without waiting in the batch system.
Most sites will allow these sorts of administrative jobs to be run on
the GRAM node, but consult your system administrator to be sure. 
Also, note, that the job contact returned from **++globus-job-submit++**
can be used to get information about the job from any computer, provided
you have GRAM tools installed and your security environment set up. 
--------
%  globus-job-submit

=======================================================================


==== Advanced Jobs with globus-job-run ====




.Using custom RSL clauses with globus-job-run
=======================================================================
The following command line submits an mpi job using
**++globus-job-run++**, setting the ++jobtype++ RSL attribute to
++mpi++. Any RSL attribute understood by the LRM can be added to a job
via this method. 
--------
%  globus-job-run 
Hello, MPI (rank: 0, count: 5)
Hello, MPI (rank: 3, count: 5)
Hello, MPI (rank: 1, count: 5)
Hello, MPI (rank: 4, count: 5)
Hello, MPI (rank: 2, count: 5)
                
--------

=======================================================================




.Constructing RSL strings with globus-job-run
=======================================================================
The **++globus-job-run++** program can also generate the RSL language
description of a job based on the command-line options given to it. This
example combines some of the features above and prints out the resulting
RSL. This RSL string can be passed to tools such as **++globusrun++** to
be run later. 
--------
%  globus-job-run -dumprsl 
 &(jobtype=mpi)
    (executable="a.out")
    (environment= ("GRID" "1") ("TEST" "1"))
    (count=5)
--------

=======================================================================


[[gram5-user-globusrun]]
=== Advanced GRAM Client with the globusrun tool ===

The link:../../gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-cmd-globusrun[**++globusrun++**]
tool provides a more flexible tool for submitting, monitoring, and
canceling jobs. With this tool, most of the functionality of the GRAM5
APIs are made available from the command-line. 

One major difference between **++globusrun++** and the other tools
described above is that **++globusrun++** uses the
link:../../gram5/pi/index.html#gram5-rsl[RSL language] to provide the job
description, instead of multiple command-line options to describe the
various aspects of the job. The section on **++globus-job-run++**
contained a brief example RSL in the '-dumprsl' example above. 

The following sections show examples of the different modes that
**++globusrun++** can run in. Full information about **++globusrun++**
command-line options is available in the public interface guide. 


==== Checking RSL Syntax ====

This example shows how to check that an RSL document contains a
syntactically correct job description. Note that this mode does not do
semantic validation of the RSL, so an RSL document that passes this test
may not work when submitted to a GRAM5 service. 




.Checking RSL Syntax
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -p "&(executable=a.out)"

RSL Parsed Successfully...

%  globusrun -p "&/executable=a.out)"

ERROR: cannot parse RSL &/executable=/adfadf/adf /adf /adf)

Syntax: globusrun [-help] [-f RSL file] [-s][-b][-d][...] [-r RM] [RSL]


Use -help to display full usage
--------

=======================================================================


==== Checking Service Contacts ====

This example shows how to check that a **++globus-gatekeeper++** is
running at a particular contact and that the client and service have
mutually-trusted credentials. 




.GRAM Authentication test
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -a -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs
GRAM Authentication test successful
%  globusrun -a -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-lsf
GRAM Authentication test failure: the gatekeeper failed to find the requested service
%  globusrun -a -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs:host@not.example.org
GRAM Authentication test failure: an authorization operation failed
globus_xio_gsi: gss_init_sec_context failed.
GSS Major Status: Unexpected Gatekeeper or Service Name
globus_gsi_gssapi: Authorization denied: The name of the remote host
(host@not.example.org), and the expected name for the remote host
(grid.example.org) do not match. This happens when the name in the host
certificate does not match the information obtained from DNS and is often a DNS
configuration problem.
                
--------
=======================================================================

[NOTE]
--
The DNS configuration problem was a common issue in GRAM2, but GRAM5
will not depend on DNS to resolve names for mutual authentication. 

--



==== Checking GRAM service version ====

This example shows how to determine what software version of GRAM5 is
deployed at a particular service contact. 




.GRAM version check
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -j -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs:host@not.example.org
Toolkit version: 4.3.0-HEAD
Job Manager version: 10.5 (1256257907-0)
                
--------
=======================================================================

[NOTE]
--
This example shows the version number for an unreleased development
version of GRAM5. The actual numbers returned will be different. 

--
[NOTE]
--
This feature is new in GRAM5. When contacting a GRAM2 service,
**++globusrun++** will display the following error message: 

--------
GRAM version check failed : an incoming HTTP message did not contain the expected information
--------


--


==== Basic Interactive job with globusrun ====

This example shows how to submit interactive job with **++globusrun++**.
When the '-s' is used, the output of the job command is returned to the
client and displayed as if the command ran locally. This is similar to
the behavior of the **++globus-job-run++** program described above. 




.Basic Interactive Job
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -s -r example.grid.org/jobmanager-pbs "&(executable=/bin/hostname)(count=5)"
node03.grid.example.org
node01.grid.example.org
node02.grid.example.urg
node05.grid.example.org
node04.grid.example.org
--------

=======================================================================


==== Basic batch job with globusrun ====

This example shows how to submit, monitor, and cancel a batch job using
**++globusrun++**. This method is useful for the case where the job may
run for a long time, the job may be queued for a long time, or when
there are network reliability issues between the client and service. 




.Basic Batch Job
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -b -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs "&(executable=/bin/sleep)(arguments=500)"
globus_gram_client_callback_allow successful
GRAM Job submission successful
https://grid.example.org:38824/16001608125017717261/5295612977486019989/
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_PENDING
%  globusrun -status https://grid.example.org:38824/16001608125017717261/5295612977486019989/
PENDING
%  globusrun -k https://grid.example.org:38824/16001608125017717261/5295612977486019989/
%  
--------

=======================================================================


==== Refreshing a GRAM5 Credential ====

The following example shows how to refresh the credential used by a job
manager and a job. 




.Refreshing a Credential
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -refresh-proxy https://grid.example.org:38824/16001608125017717261/5295612977486019989/
%  echo $?
0
--------
=======================================================================

[NOTE]
--
In GT 6.0, **++globusrun++** does not print any diagnostics when given
the '-refresh-proxy' command-line option. Therefore, check the exit code
as above to ensure that the refresh is successful. 

--

==== Dealing with credential expiration ====

When the Job Manager's credential is about to expire, it sends a message
to all clients registered for ++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_FAILED++
notifications that the job manager is terminating and that the job will
continue to run without the job manager. 

Any client which receives such a message can (if necessary) generate a
new proxy as described above and then submit a **restart request** to
start a job manager with a new credential. This job manager will resume
monitoring the jobs which were started prior to proxy expiration. 

In this example, the **++globusrun++** displays an error message when
the job manager's proxy is about to expire. The user creates a new proxy
and resumes monitoring the job with **++globusrun++**. 




.Proxy Expiration Example
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -r grid.example.org "&(executable=a.out)"
globus_gram_client_callback_allow successful
GRAM Job submission successful
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_ACTIVE
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_FAILED
GRAM Job failed because the user proxy expired (job is still running) (error code 131)
%  grid-proxy-init
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=example/OU=grid/CN=Joe User
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ........................................................................... Done
Your proxy is valid until: Tue Nov 10 04:25:03 2009
%  globusrun -r grid.example.org "&(restart="https://grid.example.org:1997/16001700477575114131/5295612977486005428/)"
globus_gram_client_callback_allow successful
GRAM Job submission successful
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_ACTIVE
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_DONE
--------

=======================================================================


==== File staging ====

In addition to the standard output and error stream output done by
**++globusrun++**, GRAM5 can do basic file management tasks to stage
files to the GRAM5 service node before submitting a job and to stage
files from the GRAM5 service node to a file service after the job
completes. 

GRAM5 file staging supports four URL schemes: ++ftp++, ++gsiftp++,
++http++, and ++https++. Note, that for the ++https++ scheme, GRAM
expects the file server to be running with the same identity as the
client. 

General file staging is controlled by three RSL attributes:
++file_stage_in++, ++file_stage_in_shared++, and ++file_stage_out++. In
addition, the files named by the RSL attributes ++executable++,
++stdin++ may be staged in and the files named by the RSL attributes
++stdout++ and ++stderr++ may be staged out. 

The ++file_stage_in_shared++ RSL attribute instructs GRAM to store a
local copy of the resource named by the URL in the GASS cache. This is
useful if multiple concurrent jobs will be accessing one or more common
files. The GASS cache will manage a reference count for files in the
cache and remove them when all jobs that refer to them complete. 

The following example shows how to stage a few files from a GridFTP
server to the GRAM node. It uses the ++rsl_substitution++ mechanism to
define a subsitution variable to reduce the amount of redundancy in the
job description. 




.File stage in
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -s -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs \
    "&(rsl_substitution = (GRIDFTP_SERVER gsiftp://gridftp.example.org)) \
      (executable=/bin/ls)
      (arguments=/tmp/staged_file)
      (file_stage_in = ($(GRIDFTP_SERVER)/staged_file /tmp/staged_file))"
/tmp/staged_file
--------

=======================================================================

The next example uses the ++file_stage_in_shared++ RSL attribute to
stage a file into the cache. The file is transferred from the client
using the GASS https server embedded in the **++globusrun++** program
when the '-s' option is used. 




.File stage in shared
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -s -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs \

      (arguments = -l /tmp/staged_file_link1 /tmp/staged_file_link1) \

The final staging example uses the ++file_stage_out++ RSL attribute to
transfer a file from the GRAM service to an FTP server using anonymous
FTP




.File stage out
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs \
    "&(executable=a.out) \
      (file_stage_out = (results.txt ftp://anonymous:nopass@ftp.example.org/incoming/results.txt))"
%  
--------

=======================================================================

[NOTE]
--
In all of the above cases, multiple files may be staged using any
combination of the supported URL schemes.

==== Temporary files and cleanup ====

GRAM5 supports creating a per-job scratch directory which can be used as
a place to store files that will be automatically removed by GRAM when
the job completes. It also supports an explicit list of files to remove
when the job completes. 

This example shows how to stage files into a scratch directory. It again
uses the embedded GASS https server, stages to the GRAM service, then
runs /bin/ls in the temporary directory. After the job completes, the
contents of ++$(SCRATCH_DIRECTORY)++ and the directory itself are
removed. 




.Staging to scratch directory
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -s grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs \
    "&(scratch_dir = \$(HOME)) \
      (directory = \$(SCRATCH_DIRECTORY))
      (file_stage_in = \
          (\$(GLOBUSRUN_GASS_URL)/inputfile $(SCRATCH_DIRECTORY)/inputfile)) \
      (executable = /bin/ls)"
inputfile
--------

=======================================================================

This example shows how to explicitly remove a file that was created by
the job. 




.Cleaning up a file
=======================================================================
--------
%  globusrun -s grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs \
    "&(executable = /bin/touch) \
      (arguments = temporary_file) \
      (file_clean_up = temporary_file)"
%  
--------

=======================================================================


==== Reliable job submit ====

The **++globusrun++** command supports a two-phase commit protocol to
ensure that the client knows the contact of the job which has been
created so that it can be monitored or canceled in the case of a client
or service error. The two-phase commit affects both job submission and
termination. 

The two-phase protocol is enabled by using the ++two_phase++ RSL
attribute, as in the next example. When this is enabled, job submission
will fail with the error
++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_ERROR_WAITING_FOR_COMMIT++. The client must
respond to this signal with either the
++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_SIGNAL_COMMIT_REQUEST++ or
++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_SIGNAL_COMMIT_EXTEND++ signals to either
commit the job to execution or delay the commit timeout. One of these
signals must be sent prior to the two phase commit timeout, or the job
will be discarded by the GRAM service. 

A two phase protocol is also used at job termination if the
++save_state++ RSL attribute is used along with the ++two_phase++
attribute. When the job manager sends a callback with the job state set
to ++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_DONE++ or
++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_DONE++ it will wait to clean up the job
until the two phase commit occurs. The client must reply with the
++GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_SIGNAL_COMMIT_END++ signal to cause the job
to be cleaned. Otherwise, the job will be unloaded from memory until a
client restarts the job and sends the signal. 




.Two phase commit example
=======================================================================
In this example, the user submits a job with a ++two_phase++ timeout of
30 seconds and the ++save_state++ attribute. The client must send commit
signals to ensure the job runs. 
--------
%  globusrun -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs \
    "&(two_phase = 30) \
      (save_state = yes) \
      (executable = a.out)"

globus_gram_client_callback_allow successful
GRAM Job submission successful
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_PENDING
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_ACTIVE
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_DONE
%  
--------

=======================================================================


==== Reconnecting to a job ====

If a job manager or client exits before a job has completed, the job
will continue to run. The client can reconnect to a job manager and
receive job state notifications and output using the ++restart++ RSL
attribute. 




.Restart example
=======================================================================
This example uses **++globus-job-submit++** to submit a batch job and
then **++globusrun++** to reconnect to the job. 
--------
%  globus-job-submit grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs /bin/sleep 90
https://grid.example.org:38824/16001746665595486521/5295612977486005662/
%  globusrun -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs \
    "&(restart = https://grid.example.org:38824/16001746665595486521/5295612977486005662/)"
globus_gram_client_callback_allow successful
GRAM Job submission successful
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_DONE
%  
--------

=======================================================================


==== Submitting a Java job ====

To submit a job that runs a java program, the client must ensure that
the job can find the Java interpreter and its classes. This example sets
the default ++PATH++ and ++CLASSPATH++ environment variables and uses
the shell to locate the path to the **++java++** program. 




.Java example
=======================================================================
This example uses **++globus-job-submit++** to submit a java job,
staging a jar file from a remote service. 
--------
%  globusrun -r grid.example.org/jobmanager-pbs \
    "&(environment = (PATH '/usr/bin:/bin') (CLASSPATH \$(SCRATCH_DIRECTORY)))
      (scratch_dir = \$(HOME)) 
      (directory = \$(SCRATCH_DIRECTORY))
      (rsl_substitution = (JAVA_SERVER http://java.example.org))
      (file_stage_in = 
          (\$(JAVA_SERVER)/example.jar \$(SCRATCH_DIRECTORY)/example.jar) 
          (\$(JAVA_SERVER)/support.jar \$(SCRATCH_DIRECTORY)/support.jar))
      (executable=/bin/sh)
      (arguments=-c 'java -jar example.jar')"
globus_gram_client_callback_allow successful
GRAM Job submission successful
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_PENDING
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_ACTIVE
GLOBUS_GRAM_PROTOCOL_JOB_STATE_DONE
%  
--------

== GRAM RSL Quick Reference ==


--
The GRAM RSL language is described in detail in the
link:../../gram5/developer/index.html#gram5-rsl[GRAM Developer's Guide].
For basic use, job description RSLs consist of a set of RSL attributes
preceded by the & character. The basic job description looks like: 

--------
&
    (attribute = value )
    (attribute = value )
    ...
    
--------


The following list contains the RSL attributes which are available in
the core job manager. Other LRM-specific RSL attributes may also be
available in some situations.
