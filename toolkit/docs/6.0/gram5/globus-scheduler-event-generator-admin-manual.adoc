== Description ==

The **++globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin++** program manages SEG

disable specific SEG modules. The '-h' command-line option shows a brief
usage message.

of the SEG modules which are available to be run by the
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++**. In the output, the service
name will be followed by its status in brackets. Possible status strings
are ++ENABLED++ and ++DISABLED++. 



=== Enabling SEG Modules ===

The '-e ' command-line option to
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin++** will cause it to enable
the module so that the init script for the
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator++** will run it. 



=== Disabling SEG Modules ===

The '-d ' command-line option to
**++globus-scheduler-event-generator-admin++** will cause it to disable
