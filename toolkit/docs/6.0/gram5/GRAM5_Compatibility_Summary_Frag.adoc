indexterm:[compatibility]

Protocol changes in GRAM since GT4 series:

* The GRAM5 service uses a superset of the GRAM2 protocol for communciation
  between the client and service. The extensions supported in GRAM5 are
  implemented in such a way that they are ignored by GRAM2 services or clients.
  These extensions provide improved error messages and version detection.
* GRAM5 does not support task coallocation using DUROC and its related
  protocols. Jobs submitted using DUROC directives will fail.
* GRAM5 does not support file streaming. The standard output and standard error
  streams are sent after the job completes instead of during execution. As a
  special case, support for the Condor grid monitor program implements a small
  subset of the streaming capabilities of GRAM2 in GT 4.2.x.
