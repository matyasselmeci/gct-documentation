== Usage Statistics Collection by the Globus Alliance ==

Beginning with GT 3.9.5, the Globus Toolkit has the capability to send usage
statistics back to the Globus Alliance.

[[whyarewedoingthis]]
=== Why are we doing this? ===

The Globus Alliance receives support from government funding agencies. In
a time of funding scarcity, these agencies must be able to demonstrate that
the scientific community is benefiting from their investment. To this end,
we want to provide generic usage data about such things as the following:

* how many people use GridFTP
* how many jobs run using GRAM

To this end, we have added support to the Globus Toolkit that will allow
installations to send us generic usage statistics. By participating in this
project, you help our funders to justify continuing their support for the
software on which you rely.

[[theoverview]]
=== The overview ===  

* Components affected for GT6 are:
** GridFTP
** GRAM5
** MyProxy
** GSI-OpenSSH


* The data sent is as generic as possible (see link:#whatissent[What is Sent?]
  below).
* Every component affected has a section titled "Usage Statistics" in its Users
  and Admin guides that lists precisely what is sent and the configuration
  control that is available (which you can use to *disable* the
  ability to send the data).
* To make this a win-win proposition, we have made the receiver for the data
  available (follow the directions
  http://www.mcs.anl.gov/%7fbester/usagestats_server/[here] This means that a
  (virtual) organization could set up their own listener and collect
  organization wide usage statistics.

[[optout]]
=== Opt-out === 
We are using opt-out rather than opt-in. The reason is that we _need_
this data - it is a requirement for funding. We're sure our fellow users would
be willing to help show that Grid Computing works and is in use. Realistically,
however, we know that if it requires any additional effort to set up usage
statistic reporting, it would drastically reduce the number of users that would
actually report the data. To be effective, we need to require zero additional
effort.

By not opting out, and allowing these statistics to be reported back, you are
explicitly supporting the further development of the Globus Toolkit.

[[whatissent]]
=== What is sent? === 

The components affected for GT6 are GridFTP, RLS, GRAM5, MyProxy and
GSI-OpenSSH. We send the "how much" data, not "the what" data.  

For instance, GridFTP sends the number of bytes, how long the transfer took,
how many streams were used, etc. It does NOT send filenames, usernames, or even
the destination IP since that would mean that the source site would make a
decision about sending information about the destination site. 

Each component has a section in its Users  and Admin guides listing what
component specific data is sent, and the Admin guide explains 
configurations related to the usage statistics. 
Links to these sections are provided here:


* link:gridftp/admin/index.html#gridftp/admin/#gridftp-usage[GridFTP]
* link:gram5/admin/index.html#gram5-usage[GRAM5]
* link:myproxy/admin/index.html#myproxy-usage[MyProxy]
* link:openssh/admin/index.html#openssh-usage[GSI-OpenSSH]


Header data that may be sent by every component, not including the
component-specific data listed above, are:

* Component identifier
* Usage data format identifier
* Time stamp
* Source IP address
* Source hostname (to differentiate between hosts with identical private IP
  addresses)


[[howisthedatasent]]
=== How is the data sent? ===
The messages are sent as a single UDP packet.  While this may cause us to lose
some data, it drastically reduces the possibility that the usage statistics
reporting can adversely affect the operation of the software.

[[whenisthedatasent]]
=== When is the data sent? ===
Once per "task" (GridFTP transfer, GRAM Job, etc), either immediately upon
startup, or at completion of the task.

[[whatwillitbeusedfor]]
=== What will the data be used for? === 

The data will be used for answering questions such as:

* How many jobs were run with GRAM last month?
* How many gigabytes of data has GridFTP moved?

We will also try and mine the data to answer operational questions such as:

* What percentage of the jobs run complete successfully?
* Of the ones that fail, what is the most common fault code returned?


The data will *NOT* be used to answer questions such as "IP 123.456.789.012
  sent 10 TB of data last month"

Our intent is to make the data that we get generic enough that we do not have
to worry what is done with it. We record the IP only for counting purposes to
know how many sites there are, but we will not produce site-specific
statistics. 

[[feedback]]
=== Feedback ===

Please send us your feedback at usage-stats@globus.org.
Feedback from our user communities will be useful in determining our path
forward with this in the future. We do ask that if you have concerns or
objections, please be specific in your feedback. For example: "Our site has a
policy against sending such data" is good information for us to know in the
future.  A link to such a policy would be even better.
