==== Credential Errors ====

The following are some common problems that may cause clients or servers
to report that credentials are invalid:

.Credential Errors
|=======================================================================
| Error Code | Definition | Possible Solutions
| ++Your proxy credential may have expired++
| Your proxy credential may have expired.
| Use link:gsic/pi/index.html#grid-proxy-info[grid-proxy-info] to check
whether the proxy credential has actually expired. If it has,
generate a new proxy with link:gsic/pi/index.html#grid-proxy-init[grid-proxy-init].
| ++The system clock on either the local or remote system
is wrong.++

| This may cause the server or client to conclude that a
credential has expired.

| Check the system clocks on the local and remote
system.

| ++Your end-user certificate may have
expired++

| Your end-user certificate may have expired

| Use link:gsic/pi/index.html#grid-cert-info[grid-cert-info] to check your
certificate's expiration date. If it has expired, follow your CA's
procedures to get a new one.

| ++The permissions may be wrong on your proxy
file++

| If the permissions on your proxy file are too lax (for
example, if others can read your proxy file), Globus Toolkit
clients will not use that file to authenticate.

| You can "fix" this problem by changing the permissions on
the file or by destroying it (with link:gsic/pi/index.html#grid-proxy-destroy[grid-proxy-destroy]) and creating a new one (with link:gsic/pi/index.html#grid-proxy-init[grid-proxy-init]).

[IMPORTANT]

However, it
is still possible that someone else has made a copy of that file
during the time that the permissions were wrong. In that case,
they will be able to impersonate you until the proxy file expires
or your permissions or end-user certificate are revoked, whichever
happens first.


| ++The permissions may be wrong on your private key
file++

| If the permissions on your end user certificate private key
file are too lax (for example, if others can read the file),
grid-proxy-init will refuse to create a proxy certificate.

| You can "fix" this by changing the permissions on the
private key file.

[IMPORTANT]

However, you will still have a
much more serious problem: it is possible that someone has made a
copy of your private key file. Although this file is encrypted, it
is possible that someone will be able to decrypt the private key,
at which point they will be able to impersonate you as long as
your end user certificate is valid. You should contact your CA to
have your end-user certificate revoked and get a new
one.

| ++The remote system may not trust your
CA++

| The remote system may not trust your CA

| Verify that the remote system is configured to trust the CA
that issued your end-entity certificate. See link:admin/install/index.html for details.

| ++You may not trust the remote system's
CA++

| You may not trust the remote system's CA

| Verify that your system is configured to trust the remote
CA (or that your environment is set up to trust the remote CA).
See admin/install/index.html for details.

| ++There may be something wrong with the remote
service's credentials++

| There may be something wrong with the remote service's
credentials

| It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between errors
reported by the remote service regarding your credentials and
errors reported by the client interface regarding the remote
service's credentials. If you cannot find anything wrong with your
credentials, check for the same conditions on the remote system
(or ask a remote administrator to do so) .

==== Some tools to validate certificate setup ====


===== grid-cert-diagnostics =====

The
link:../../gsic/user/index.html#grid-cert-diagnostics[**++grid-cert-diagnostics++**]
program checks prints diagnostics about the user's certificates, and
host security environment. 

--------
%  grid-cert-diagnostics -p
--------



===== Check that the user certificate is valid =====



--------
openssl verify -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates
  -purpose sslclient ~/.globus/usercert.pem
--------


===== Connect to the server using s_client =====



--------
openssl s_client -ssl3 -cert ~/.globus/usercert.pem -key 
  ~/.globus/userkey.pem -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates 
  -connect <host:port>
--------

Here '<host:port>' denotes the server and port you connect to.

If it prints an error and puts you back at the command prompt, then it
typically means that the **server** has closed the connection, i.e. that
the server was not happy with the client's certificate and verification.
Check the SSL log on the server.

If the command "hangs" then it has actually opened a telnet style (but
secure) socket, and you can "talk" to the server.

You should be able to scroll up and see the subject names of the
server's verification chain:



--------

depth=2 /DC=net/DC=ES/O=ESnet/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=ESnet Root CA 1
verify return:1
depth=1 /DC=org/DC=DOEGrids/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=DOEGrids CA 1
verify return:1
depth=0 /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=wiggum.mcs.anl.gov
verify return:1
    
--------

In this case, there were no errors. Errors would give you an extra line
next to the subject name of the certificate that caused the error.


===== Check that the server certificate is valid =====

Requires root login on server:



--------

    openssl verify -CApath /etc/grid-security/certificates -purpose sslserver 
     /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
--------
