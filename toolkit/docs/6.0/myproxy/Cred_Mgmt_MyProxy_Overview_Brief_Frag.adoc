MyProxy is open source software for managing X.509 Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) security credentials (certificates and private
keys). MyProxy combines an online credential repository with an online
certificate authority to allow users to securely obtain credentials when
and where needed. Users run **++myproxy-logon++** to authenticate and
obtain credentials, including trusted CA certificates and Certificate
Revocation Lists (CRLs). For more information about MyProxy, see the
http://myproxy.ncsa.uiuc.edu/[MyProxy Home Page].
