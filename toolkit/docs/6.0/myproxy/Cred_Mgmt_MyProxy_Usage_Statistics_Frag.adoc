=== MyProxy usage statistics collection ===

By default, the myproxy-server will send a UDP packet containing usage
information to usage-stats.cilogon.org:4810 after serving each request.
See the http://myproxy.ncsa.uiuc.edu/privacy[MyProxy Privacy Policy] for
details. You can see the Globus Usage Statistics policy
