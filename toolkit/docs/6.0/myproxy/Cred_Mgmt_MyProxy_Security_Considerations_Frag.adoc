=== MyProxy Security Considerations ===

You should choose a well-protected host to run the myproxy-server on.
Consult with security-aware personnel at your site. You want a host that
is secured to the level of a Kerberos KDC, that has limited user access,
runs limited services, and is well monitored and maintained in terms of
security patches. 

For a typical myproxy-server installation, the host on which the
myproxy-server is running must have /etc/grid-security created and a
host certificate installed. In this case, the myproxy-server will run as
root so it can access the host certificate and key.
