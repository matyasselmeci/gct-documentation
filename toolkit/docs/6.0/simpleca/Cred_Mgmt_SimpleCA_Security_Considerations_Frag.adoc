=== Security considerations for SimpleCA ===

The operator of a CA must protect the private key of the CA. It should
not be stored unencrypted or on a network filesystem. 

Simple CA enforces the subject name policies in the simple CA's
configuration files. If modified, the signing_policy file distributed to
clients of the CA must also be modified.
