== Building and Installing ==


[[simpleca-users]]
=== Create users ===

Make sure you have the following users on your machine:




* Your **user** account, which will be used to run the client programs.

* A **++simpleca++** account, which will be used to administer the Simple CA. This is created automatically if you install SimpleCA from RPM or Debian packages.

* A generic **++globus++** account, if you will be building from the source installer.



[[simpleca-install]]
=== Install SimpleCA ===

SimpleCA can be installed in three ways, from a debian package, from an
RPM package, and from the source installer. These installation methods
are described in link:../../admin/install/index.html[Installing GT 6.0].

To install SimpleCA from binary packages, install the packages
**++globus-simple-ca++** and **++globus-gsi-cert-utils-progs++** and
their dependencies. On Debian based systems, use the command 

--------
root# apt-get install 
--------
On RPM-based systems, use the command 

--------
root# yum install 
--------


To install SimpleCA from the source installer, build the
++globus_simple_ca++ and ++globus_gsi_cert_utils++ installer targets
with the command 

--------
globus% make 
--------
Afterward, run the command 

--------
globus% make install
--------



[[simpleca-create-ca]]
== Creating a SimpleCA ==


--
If you install the globus-simpleca Debian or RPM package, it will
automatically create a **++simpleca++** user and a Simple CA in
++/var/lib/globus/simple_ca++. If want to create a custom CA, or are
using the source installer, you'll need to do the following. Otherwise,
you can skip to the . If want to create a custom CA, or are using the
source installer, you'll need to do the following. Otherwise, you can
skip to the link:#simplecaAdmin-using[Using a SimpleCA]
chapter of the SimpleCA documentation, as these steps have already been
done. 


--

=== Create SimpleCA Administrator Account ===

Create a user to adminster the SimpleCA. You can use the the
**++globus++** user you used to build Globus, or another user that you
create. For the purposes of this document, we'll assume a user named
**++simpleca++**. Log in to that user, and run the
**++grid-ca-create++** command. This will prompt for information needed
to name the certificate, how to contact the CA administrator, lifetime
of the CA certificate, and passphrase, and will then generate the new CA
certificate and private key. Command-line options described in
link:../../simpleca/admin/index.html#grid-ca-create[**++grid-ca-create++**] can
be used to avoid some of these prompts. 


=== Invoking **++grid-ca-create++** ===

If you are creating a SimpleCA for testing purposes, you can use the
'-noint' command-line option to **++grid-ca-create++** to use the
default values for all prompts like this: 

--------
simpleca% grid-ca-create -noint
--------
This will create a SimpleCA in the **++simpleca++**'s home directory
with the passphrase ++globus++. You can then move on to the
link:#simplecaAdmin-using[Using a SimpleCA] chapter of
this document. For step-by-step details to create a customized SimpleCA,
continue reading this chapter. 

As the **++simpleca++** user, run the command **++grid-ca-create++**,
and you'll see output like this: 

--------
simpleca% grid-ca-create
    C e r t i f i c a t e    A u t h o r i t y    S e t u p

This script will setup a Certificate Authority for signing Globus
users certificates.  It will also generate a simple CA package
that can be distributed to the users of the CA.

The CA information about the certificates it distributes will
be kept in:

/home/simpleca/.globus/simpleCA
--------
This intro screen shows the path that the CA will be created into (in
this example, ++/home/simpleca/.globus/simpleCA++). The other commands
needed by SimpleCA will automatically look in that path by default when
invoked by the ). The other commands needed by SimpleCA will
automatically look in that path by default when invoked by the
**++simpleca++** user. 


[[simpleca-subjectname]]
=== Configure the subject name ===

The **++grid-ca-create++** program next prompts you for information
about the name of CA you wish to create: 

--------
The unique subject name for this CA is:
cn=Globus Simple CA, ou=simpleCA-elephant.globus.org, ou=GlobusTest, o=Grid

Do you want to keep this as the CA subject (y/n) [y]:
--------


To accept the default name, enter ++y++. To choose a different name,
type ++n++, after which you will be prompted by 

--------
Enter a unique subject name for this CA: 
--------


The subject name is an X.509 distinguished name. Typical name component
type abbreviations used in Grids are: 

**cn**::
     Represents "common name". It identifies this particular certificate as the CA
                    Certificate within the "GlobusTest/simpleCA-elephant.globus.org" domain, which in this case is Globus Simple CA.

**ou**::
     Represents "organizational unit". It identifies this CA from other CAs created by SimpleCA by other people. The second "ou" is specific to your hostname (in this case GlobusTest).

**o**::
     Represents "organization". It identifies the Grid.



[[simpleca-email]]
=== Configure the CA's email ===

The next prompt looks like this: 

--------
Enter the email of the CA (this is the email where certificate
requests will be sent to be signed by the CA) [simpleca@elephant.globus.org]: 
--------


Enter the email address where you intend to receive certificate
requests. It should be your real email address that you check, not the
address of the globus user. When users request certificates with
**++grid-cert-request++**, they will be instructed to send the request
to this address.


[[simpleca-expiration]]
=== Configure the expiration date ===

Then you'll see: 



--------

The CA certificate has an expiration date. Keep in mind that 
once the CA certificate has expired, all the certificates 
signed by that CA become invalid.  A CA should regenerate 
the CA certificate and start re-issuing ca-setup packages 
before the actual CA certificate expires.  This can be done 
by re-running this setup script.  Enter the number of DAYS 
the CA certificate should last before it expires.
[default: 5 years 1825 days]:
--------

This is the number of days for which the CA certificate is valid. Once
this time expires, the CA certificate will have to be recreated. 

To accept the default, hit **++enter++**, or otherwise, enter a value in
days.


[[simpleca-passphrase]]
=== Create a Passphrase to Encrypt the CA's Private Key ===

The next prompt will be for the passphrase for the CA's private key. It
will be used to decrypt the CA's private key when signing certificates.
It should be hard to guess, as its compromise might compromise all the
certificates signed by the CA. You will be prompted twice for the
passphrase, to verify that you typed it correctly. Enter the passphrase
at these prompts. 

--------
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
--------



[[simpleca-packageoutput]]
=== SimpleCA Distribution Files ===

Finally **++grid-ca-create++** will create a tarball containing the
public information about the CA, including its public certificate,
signing policy, and supported X.509v3 extensions. This information is
needed on machines that will be trusting the CA, and also on machines
which will be used to request certificates from this CA. 

Since we didn't run in this example as root, **++grid-ca-create++** will
not be able to write the CA files to system paths, so it displays a
warning message indicating that. We can use the tarball output here, or
packages described below to install the CA support files on this and
other machines.

The package output summary looks like this: 

--------
Insufficient permissions to install CA into the trusted certifiicate
directory (tried ${sysconfdir}/grid-security/certificates and
${datadir}/certificates)
Creating RPM source tarball... done
	globus_simple_ca_68ea3306
--------


This information will be important for setting up other machines in your
grid. The number '68ea3306' in the last line is known as your **CA
hash**. It is an 8 digit hexadecimal string which is a hash of the
subject name of the CA certificate.

The tarball contains Debian and RPM package metadata, so that it can be
compiled to a binary package which can be easily installed on this and
other systems on your Grid. It can also be packaged as a GPT setup
package for compatibility with older versions of the Globus Toolkit.


[[simpleca-binarypkgs]]
=== Generating Binary CA Packages ===

The
link:../../simpleca/admin/index.html#grid-ca-package[**++grid-ca-package++**]
command can be used to generate RPM, debian, or legacy GPT packages for a
SimpleCA, or for any other CA which is installed on a host. These packages can
make it easy to distribute the CA certificate and policy to other hosts
with which you want to establish Grid trust relationships. 


==== Generating RPM Packages ====

To generate an RPM package for the CA which we created, use the
following command: 

--------
simpleca% grid-ca-package -r -cadir ~/.globus/simpleCA
Creating RPM source tarball... done
        globus_simple_ca_68ea3306.tar.gz
Creating RPM binary.../home/simpleca/globus-simple-ca-68ea3306
--------
The resulting rpm package will be placed in the current directory. As
root, you can install this via the **++yum++** or **++rpm++** tools.
This package can then be installed on any RPM-based system. 


==== Generating Debian Packages ====

To generate an Debian package for the CA which we created, use the
following command: 

--------
simpleca% grid-ca-package -d -cadir ~/.globus/simpleCA
    Creating RPM source tarball... done
        globus_simple_ca_68ea3306.tar.gz
Creating debian binary...dpkg-buildpackage: export CFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags (origin: vendor): -g -O2

--------
The resulting debian package will be placed in the current directory. As
root, you can install this via the **++dpkg++** tool.


==== Generating GPT Packages ====

The **++grid-ca-package++** command can also generate GPT packages in
the form similar to previous versions of the Globus Toolkit. This is
done with the '-g' and '-b' command-line options. See
link:../../simpleca/admin/index.html#grid-ca-package[**++grid-ca-package++**]
for more details.


[[simplecaAdmin-using]]
== Using a SimpleCA ==


--
As a CA, your main task will be to sign certificates. To sign a
certificate request, use the tool **++grid-ca-sign++**. This tool reads
a certificate request (such as those created by
link:../../gsic/user/index.html#grid-cert-request[**++grid-cert-request++**]) and creates a
certificate signed by the CA certificate with the public key from in the
certificate request. This indicates that you confirm that the identity
of the certificate matches its name. You can use the **++openssl++**
command to view the contents of the certificate request. 


--

=== Examining a Certificate Request ===

To examine a certificate request, use the command **++openssl req -text
-in ++**, as shown in the following example.

        ae:be
--------

In this case, you see a certificate request with the subject
distinguished name ++o=Grid, OU=GlobusTest,
OU=simpleCA-elephant.globus.org, OU=local, CN=Joe User++. 

=======================================================================


=== Signing a Certificate Request ===

If you are satisfied with the certificate request and are willing to
sign it, use the **++grid-ca-sign++** command to do so. The command will
store a copy of the newly signed certificate in the SimpleCA directory,
so that you can keep track of what you've signed, and will also write it
to the value of the '-out' parameter. Transmit this result file back to
the user which requested the certificate. 




.Sign with **++grid-ca-sign++**
=======================================================================
--------
simpleca% grid-ca-sign -in certreq.pem -out cert.pem


To sign the request
please enter the password for the CA key: 

The new signed certificate is at: /home/simpleca/.globus/simpleCA/newcerts/01.pem
--------

=======================================================================

Once you've signed the certificate, if it is a user certificate, you
must communicate it back to the user, perhaps via email. 


=== Revoking a Certificate ===

SimpleCA does not yet provide a convenient interface to revoke a signed
certificate, but it can be done with the **++openssl++** command. 


.Revoke a certificate
=======================================================================
--------
simpleca% openssl ca -config ~/.globus/simpleCA/grid-ca-ssl.conf -revoke ~/.globus/simpleCA/newcerts/01.pem
Using configuration from /home/simpleca/.globus/simpleCA/grid-ca-ssl.conf
Enter pass phrase for /home/simpleca/.globus/simpleCA/private/cakey.pem:
Revoking Certificate 01.
Data Base Updated
--------

=======================================================================


Once a certificate is revoked, you can generate a Certificate Revocation
List (CRL) for your CA, which will be a signed list of certificates
which have been revoked. Sites which use your CA will need to keep the
CRL up to date to be able to reject revoked certificates. This CRL can
be generated with an **++openssl++** command. See ++ca(1)++ for details
about how to control the CRL lifetime and other options.


.Create CRL
=======================================================================
--------
simpleca% openssl ca -config ~/.globus/simpleCA/grid-ca-ssl.conf -gencrl > 
Using configuration from /home/simpleca/.globus/simpleCA/grid-ca-ssl.conf
Enter pass phrase for /home/simpleca/.globus/simpleCA/private/cakey.pem:

--------

=======================================================================


The output file ++CAHASH.crl++ (based on the hash of your CA subject
name) should be distributed to sites which trust your CA, so that they
can install it into the trusted certificate directory.  (based on the
hash of your CA subject name) should be distributed to sites which trust
your CA, so that they can install it into the trusted certificate
directory. 


=== Renewing a CA ===

The **++openssl++** command can be used to renew a CA certificate. This
will generate a new CA certificate with the same subject name and
private key as before, but valid for a different time interval. This new
certificate packaged and distributed as before using
link:../../simpleca/admin/index.html#grid-ca-package[**++grid-ca-package++**]. 




.Renew CA Certificate
=======================================================================

--------
simpleca% openssl req -key ~/.globus/simpleCA/private/cakey.pem -new -x509 -days 1825 -out newca.pem -config ~/.globus/simpleCA/grid-ca-ssl.conf
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
 -----
Level 0 Organization [Grid]:
Level 0 Organizational Unit [GlobusTest]:
Level 1 Organizational Unit [simpleCA-elephant.globus.org]:
Name (E.g., John M. Smith) []:Globus Simple CA
--------

=======================================================================

[IMPORTANT]
--
The Subject Name of the new certificate must match **exactly** the
previous certificate name, or clients will not recognize it as the
correct certificate.
