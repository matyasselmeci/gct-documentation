Introduction
------------
This guide contains advanced configuration information for system
administrators working with SimpleCA. It provides references to
information on procedures typically performed by system administrators,
including installation, configuring, deploying, and testing the
installation.

[IMPORTANT]
--
This information is in addition to the basic Globus Toolkit prerequisite, overview, installation, security configuration instructions in the link:../..//admin/install/index.html[Installing GT 6.0]. Read through this guide before continuing!

The following are instructions for how to use SimpleCA to request and
sign a certificate for a GT 6.0 installation. 
SimpleCA provides an easy way to create and package a Certificate
Authority
(CA), as well as tools for requesting and signing user and
host certificates. It is similar to OpenSSL's **++CA.sh++** command but
includes support for packaging the CA certificate, creating a signing
policy file, and generating information needed by clients to request
certificates. You can find other CA options in
link:../..//admin/install/index.html#gtadmin-basic-host[Obtain host
credentials].
